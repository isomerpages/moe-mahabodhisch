delegated Miss Pitt Chin Hui and others, aided by Buddhist believers, to undertake the  
establishing of Maha Bodhi School. A shophouse at No. 743, Geylang Road became a temporary  
school building with about 40 pupils. On 12 January 1948, the school was officially declared  
open. The first principal was Sister Wong Loon Soo.
