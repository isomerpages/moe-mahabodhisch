      <p>One of the programmes which will make the Crestian student distinctive from his or her peers in other schools would be the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which focuses on effective communication. Named ‘Effective Communicators of the 21st Century’, this programme envisions our students to be effective communicators who impact with the heart and mind, putting their language competencies to good use at the workplace and in the society, hence our ALP Vision: _**Effective communicators who impact with the heart and mind**_.
