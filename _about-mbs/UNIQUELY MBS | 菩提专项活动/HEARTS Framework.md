<h3><strong>Positive Education through the HEARTS Framework</strong></h3>
<p>Our school partners with key stakeholders to equip our pupils with the
right mindset, essential life skills, and overall well-being to navigate
the complexities of both the digital and real world.</p>
<p>Guided by the principles of Positive Education and the PERMAH framework—which
focuses on cultivating <em>Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning,</em>  <em>Accomplishment and Health </em>—we
promote mindfulness, resilience, healthy relationships, and a balanced
lifestyle in our students.</p>
<p>We create a caring, inclusive, and empowering environment where every
pupil can flourish through the <strong>HEARTS framework</strong>, which
brings Positive Education to life in the following ways:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Positive Health and Positive Engagement</strong>:
Creating a safe and supportive learning environment, and delivering a dynamic
and engaging curriculum.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Positive Action</strong>: Empowering
pupils to take initiative and make meaningful contributions through purposeful
projects.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Positive Relationships</strong>: Fostering
a strong sense of belonging by nurturing a caring and inclusive school
culture.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAP Ethos</strong>: Deepening pupils’
appreciation of Chinese culture and the rich cultural diversity in Singapore
to strengthen their national and cultural identity.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Through HEARTS, we nurture confident and compassionate learners who are
ready to thrive in a complex and ever-changing world.</p>
