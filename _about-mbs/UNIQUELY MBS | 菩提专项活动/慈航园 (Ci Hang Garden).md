<h4><strong>慈航园 (<em>Ci Hang Garden)</em></strong></h4>
<p>To honour the memory of Reverend Chee Hong and his profound dedication
to spreading the Dharma for the welfare of all beings, the school has named
this newly renovated courtyard <em>Ci Hang Garden</em>, officially inaugurated
in July 2025.</p>
<p>Reverend Chee Hong (1895–1954) was born in Jianning, Fujian Province.
Throughout his life, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to Buddhist education
and the propagation of the Dharma. His missionary journeys took him across
China and beyond to Burma, Malaysia, and Singapore. He established numerous
Buddhist societies, academies, and publications.</p>
<p>In 1946, Reverend Chee Hong made a solemn vow to advance Buddhist education.
He entrusted Miss Pitt Chin Hui and her colleagues with the establishment
of Maha Bodhi School, dedicated to nurturing young minds while spreading
Buddha's teachings.</p>
<p>During his later years, Reverend Chee Hong focused his efforts on teaching
the sutras and producing scholarly works. He passed on in 1954 at the age
of sixty, having devoted forty-two years to monastic life.</p>
<p><em>Ci Hang Garden</em> honours Reverend Chee Hong's vision and contributions
while symbolising the school's commitment to Buddhist education and the
cultivation of compassion and wisdom.</p>

<p>为缅怀慈航法师弘法利生之宏愿与功德，我校特将翻新后的庭院命名为“慈航园”，并于2025年7月正式启用。</p>
<p>慈航法师（1895–1954），福建建宁人。毕生致力佛教教育与弘法事业，足迹遍及中国各地，并远赴缅甸、马来西亚、新加坡弘法。曾创办佛学会、佛学院及佛学刊物。</p>
<p>1946年，法师发愿兴办佛化教育，委托毕俊辉女士等人筹建菩提学校，广育英才，弘扬佛法。</p>
<p>晚年专注讲经著述，1954年圆寂，世寿六十，僧腊四十二。</p>
<p>“慈航园”的设立，既是我校对法师弘愿与贡献的深切追思，也是延续佛化教育精神、弘扬慈悲智慧的重要象征。</p>
