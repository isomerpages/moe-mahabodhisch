## Applied Learning Programme 

**APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME**

Our Programme is entitled “ELECTA@MBS- Empathetic Listeners.  Effective Communicators. Trailblazing Advocates”. It is aligned to the school’s vision of “Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character” and mission to develop the potential in every child to the fullest and nurture them as concerned citizens, morally upright and rooted in Chinese Culture. The school seeks to develop an ALP that complements the school’s effort to nurture confident and empathetic communicators who contribute actively to make a difference.  The school aspires to nurture each and every pupil into

*   an empathetic listener who tunes in to feedback and different perspectives;
*   an effective communicator who speaks confidently; and
*   an advocate who has innovative ideas, speaks up and takes action to make a difference in response to the needs of the community and environment; and thereby impacts others positively

The school believes in equipping the pupils with skills to help them achieve future-ready competencies such as embracing and thinking critically about different perspectives, communicating and collaborating with others with a set of attitudes and skills, and delivering impactful presentations to make a positive difference.

All MBS pupils will also go through a series of developmental opportunities to establish a common baseline of communication skills. This includes the two signature ALP activities that will be delivered during their Primary 3 and Primary 5 years. Pupils will translate their learning to focus and work on impacting the community through environmental and social causes.

**Primary 3 – ‘My School, My Responsibility’ (Video Log)**

Pupils go through 8 sessions to hone their presentations skills in order to deliver powerful presentation. During their level Values-in-Action project, ‘My School, My Responsibility’, pupils work in teams to promote school-improvement projects. Pupils learn to communicate their ideas and arrive at a consensus for their team project. They produce videos to raise awareness and concern, and to rally support in making a positive difference.

**Primary 5 – Waste Not, Want Not**

Primary 5 pupil learn public speaking skills such as projecting stage presence and delivering a persuasive presentation before their audience. During their level Values-in Action project, Waste Not, Want Not’, pupils will apply their public speaking skills when they take to the stage to share with the school on the challenges faced by Singapore in managing waste, and our waste management system. They will share information about the limitations of Pulau Semakau as well as 3R efforts to promote responsible decision-making related to going green.
