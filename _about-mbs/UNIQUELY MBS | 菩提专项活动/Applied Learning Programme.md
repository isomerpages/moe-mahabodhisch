## Applied Learning Programme 

**APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME**

Our Programme is entitled “ELECTA@MBS- Empathetic Listeners.&nbsp; Effective Communicators. Trailblazing Advocates”. It is aligned to the school’s vision of “Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character” and mission to develop the potential in every child to the fullest and nurture them as concerned citizens, morally upright and rooted in Chinese Culture. The school seeks to develop an ALP that complements the school’s effort to nurture confident and empathetic communicators who contribute actively to make a difference.&nbsp; The school aspires to nurture each and every pupil into

*   an empathetic listener who tunes in to feedback and different perspectives;
*   an effective communicator who speaks confidently; and
*   an advocate who has innovative ideas, speaks up and takes action to make a difference in response to the needs of the community and environment; and thereby impacts others positively

The school believes in equipping the pupils with skills to help them achieve future-ready competencies such as embracing and thinking critically about different perspectives, communicating and collaborating with others with a set of attitudes and skills, and delivering impactful presentations to make a positive difference.

All MBS pupils will also go through a series of developmental opportunities to establish a common baseline of communication skills. This includes the two signature ALP activities that will be delivered during their Primary 3 and Primary 5 years. Pupils will translate their learning to focus and work on impacting the community through environmental and social causes.

        

我们的项目名为“ELECTA@MBS - 富有共情能力的倾听者，有效沟通者和开拓性的倡导者”。该项目与学校的愿景“培育品学兼优的学习者”相契合，并与学校的使命一致，即充分发掘每个孩子的潜能，培养他们成为关心他人、品德端正、心系中华文化的公民。  
学校致力于发展应用学习课程 （ALP），以配合学校现有的育人工作，培养自信且具有共情能力的沟通者，激励他们积极投入社会，创造价值。

学校致力于将每一位学生都培养成：

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 富有同理心的倾听者，能够听取他人意见，尊重不同的观点；

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 谈吐自信的有效沟通者；和

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 富有创新思维的行动倡导者，能够为社区和环境的需求发声并采取行动，从而对他人产生积极影响

学校致力于培养学生未来所需的核心能力，让他们学会批判性地思考及接纳不同的观点，具备与人沟通协作的态度和技能，并能够有效地表达自己的观点，为社会创造价值。

所有菩提生将经历系列培训，建立基础沟通技能。这包括将在小学三年级和五年级期间开展的两项标志性 ALP 活动。学生会学以致用，通过参与环保和社会公益活动为社区出一份力。
