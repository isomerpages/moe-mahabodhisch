## Principal’s Message

2022 has been a meaningful year as we transited smoothly to the total delivery of quality teaching and learning, just like during pre-COVID times. I am deeply appreciative to our colleagues for their relentless efforts in planning and implementing the resumption of in-person CCAs, physical learning journey, P5 cohort camp, SYF and NSG. These are precious learning experiences that complement our pupils’ learning in the classrooms and enhance their social emotional competencies. I am also thankful to our parents for their trust in our processes to imbue important values in our pupils’ character building. With their support, we can provide a holistic education for all our Maha Bodhians.

Our school’s vision of nurturing **_Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character_** guides us in all that we do in our mission to develop the potential of every child to the fullest and nurture them to be concerned citizens, morally upright and rooted in Chinese culture. Our school motto – **敦品励学**, exalts our pupils to be steadfast in character and possess a thirst for knowledge. Our school values – **_Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion,_** _and **Excellence**_ are our anchor in inculcating a values-driven mindset in our pupils.

We believe that, in close partnership with our parents, we will be able to guide our pupils to adopt the right thoughts, demonstrate the right actions, and articulate the right speech. It takes a village to raise a child, and I look forward to working closely with all our stakeholders as we nurture our pupils and enable them to soar to greater heights. We will continue to strive to provide the best education for our pupils to make a difference in their lives as they pursue their aspirations in Maha Bodhi School — a school of choice, distinction and pride. Together, with one united heart and mind, we can achieve more.

May I wish all a happy and fulfilling 2023.

May you and your loved ones be well and happy.

Thank you.

With warm regards,

Mrs See Lai Kwan

菩提学校在贯彻“品德高尚的乐学者”的愿景时，也秉承“敦品励学”的校训，并遵循我校的五大价值观－尊重、坚韧、正直、仁爱和卓越，致力发展每个学生的潜能并培育他们成为具有华族文化素养、德才兼备的社会栋梁。

树人与育人是教育使命的重中之重。期望在教育部、佛教总会、校友会和家长会的鼎立支持下，加上家长伙伴的信任及教职团队全心全力的付出，菩提的孩子们都能在学习的道路上茁壮成长，在学业上和全人的发展上获得成就！
