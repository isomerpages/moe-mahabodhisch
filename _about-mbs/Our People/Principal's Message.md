## Principal’s Message

2021 has been a challenging yet fruitful year for all of us in ensuring that quality teaching and learning continues amidst the uncertainty due to COVID-19. I am deeply appreciative to all our staff for their relentless efforts during this period as we implement HBL, e-CCAs and Safe Management Measures to keep our school a safe learning environment for all. We are also thankful to our parents for their trust in our Teaching and Learning processes, especially with the removal of SA2 last year. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all parents for your support and belief in us.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank the prior School Leadership Team, led by Mrs Elaine Quek, for laying a strong foundation in the school processes to support the pupils’ learning. I am also appreciative of the warm welcome extended to me by Venerable Seck Kwang Phing and our School Management Committee, as well as staff and pupils of Maha Bodhi School. I am honoured to have this privileged opportunity to serve Maha Bodhi School. Together with my new leadership team, comprising Mr Victor Wee (VP1), Mrs Koh Ming Hwee (VP2) and Mdm Leng Bing Ling (VPA), I seek your support as we continue the good work laid by my predecessors to provide a holistic education for all Maha Bodhians.

Our school’s vision of nurturing **_Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character_** guides us in all that we do in our mission to develop the potential of every child to the fullest and nurture them to be concerned citizens, morally upright and rooted in Chinese culture. Our school motto – **敦品励学**, exalts our pupils to be steadfast in character and possess a thirst for knowledge. Our school values – **_Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion,_** _and **Excellence**_ are our anchor in inculcating a values-driven mind-set in our pupils.

We believe that, in close partnership with our parents, we will be able to guide our pupils to adopt the right thoughts, demonstrate the right actions, and articulate the right speech. It takes a village to raise a child, and I look forward to working closely with all our stakeholders as we nurture our pupils and enable them to soar to greater heights. We will continue to strive to provide the best education for our pupils to make a difference in their lives as they pursue their aspirations in Maha Bodhi School — a school of choice, distinction and pride. Together, with one united heart and mind, we can achieve more.

May I wish all a happy and fulfilling year ahead.

May you and your loved ones be well and happy.

Thank you.

With warm regards,

Mrs See Lai Kwan

Principal

我很荣幸，也感恩有机会加入菩提学校的领导班子。由衷感谢由林惠珉校长领导的学校团队，为学校及学生的学习奠定了坚实的基础。也感谢广品法师，学校管理委员会，菩提学校教职员的热烈欢迎。我与我的新领导团队 —  黄耀生副校长(VP1)、汪明慧副校长 (VP2) 和 梁冰凌副校长(VPA)，也承诺在现有的基础上，致力为菩提学生制造一个全方位学习的教育环境。

菩提学校在贯彻“品德高尚的乐学者”的愿景时，也秉承“敦品励学”的校训，并遵循我校的五大价值观－尊重、坚韧、正直、仁爱和卓越，致力发展每个学生的潜能并培育他们成为具有华族文化素养、德才兼备的社会栋梁。

树人与育人是教育使命的重中之重。期望在教育部、佛教总会、校友会和家长会的鼎立支持下，加上家长伙伴的信任及教职团队全心全力的付出，菩提的孩子们都能在学习的道路上茁壮成长，在学业上和全人的发展上获得成就！
