## Principal’s Message

    

2023 has been a meaningful year as we celebrated an important milestone in our school’s history – our 75th anniversary. Themed ‘Gratitude and Giving’, the celebrations sought to cultivate in our pupils the sense of gratitude and be appreciative of the efforts of many people who have supported the school, and to plant the seed of compassion and demonstrate the actions of contributing to society. I am deeply appreciative to our colleagues for their efforts in planning and implementing the varied learning experiences such as Experiential Learning Week, physical learning journeys, P5 cohort camp and NSG for our pupils. These are precious learning experiences that inspire our pupils to be motivated learners and innovative problem solvers, and to be compassionate contributors anchored in values. I am also thankful to our parents for their trust in our processes to imbue important values in our pupils’ character building. With their support, we can provide a holistic education for all our Maha Bodhians. &nbsp;

Looking forward, our school went through a re-envisioning exercise and refreshed our mission and strategic plan. Our school’s vision of nurturing **_Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character_** guides us in all that we do in our mission to nurture confident life-long learners and compassionate contributors with a deep connection to the Chinese culture.&nbsp; Our school motto – **敦品励学**, exalts our pupils to be steadfast in character and possess a thirst for knowledge. Our school values – **_Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion,_** _and **Excellence**_ are our anchor in inculcating a values-driven mindset in our pupils. Our pupils are our focus. We seek to enhance their well-being through a caring and enabling environment. Our staff are our anchor. We seek to enable and empower our staff to build competency collectively.

We believe that, in close partnership with our parents, we will be able to guide our pupils to adopt the right thoughts, demonstrate the right actions, and articulate the right speech. It takes a village to raise a child, and I look forward to working closely with all our stakeholders as we nurture our pupils and enable them to soar to greater heights. We will continue to strive to provide the best education for our pupils to make a difference in their lives as they pursue their aspirations in Maha Bodhi School -- a school of choice, distinction and pride. Together, with one united heart and mind, we can achieve more.

May I wish all a happy and fulfilling 2024.

May you and your loved ones be well and happy.

Thank you.

With warm regards, <br>
Mrs See Lai Kwan <br>

**2024 校长献词**

2023是个富有意义的一年！菩提学校见证了重要的里程碑 \- 欢庆75周年校庆。75周年校庆以“感恩与回馈”为主题。通过校庆，我们希望学生们能对许多前辈们的付出心怀感恩。正所谓“取之于社会，用之于社会”，我们也致力于培育以道德为基础且心怀慈悲的贡献者，希望学生们为回馈社会尽一份力。菩提学校的教职员们努力不懈，齐心合作，就为了让孩子们参与高质量学习，例如体验式学习周，学习之旅，五年级户外探险营与全国校际运动会。这些宝贵的学习体验能激发学生成为积极，自主的学习者并具有以创新手法面对问题的解决者。我们感谢家长们给予的信任。因为有您的支持，我们能致力为菩提学生制造一个全方位学习的教育环境。

学校在2023年检讨办校方针，并更新我校的宗旨与策略方针。菩提学校在贯彻“品德高尚的乐学者”的愿景时，也秉承“敦品励学”的校训，并遵循我校的五大价值观－尊重、坚韧、正直、仁爱和卓越，致力培养心系华夏文化且自信的终身学习者和怀有慈悲心的贡献者发展每个学生的潜能并培育他们成为具有华族文化素养、德才兼备的社会栋梁。每个学生是我们的关注。我们希望通过打造一个有利于学生全面发展且充满关爱的环境来提升学生的福祉。每个教员是我们的支柱。我们希望赋予教职员集体建设的能力。

树人与育人是教育使命的重中之重。期望在教育部、佛教总会、校友会和家长会的鼎立支持下，加上家长伙伴的信任及教职团队全心全力的付出，菩提的孩子们都能在学习的道路上茁壮成长，在学业上和全人的发展上获得成就！

祝欢喜吉祥，如意安康！
