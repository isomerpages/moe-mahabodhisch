<h2>Principal’s Message</h2>
<p>As we embark on a new year, we are filled with optimism and excitement
for what lies ahead for our Maha Bodhi School community. The past year
has been one of reflection and growth, building upon the foundation laid
by our pioneering school leaders, staff, students and partners.</p>
<p>Our school vision of nurturing Inspired Learners of Exemplary Character
continues to guide our efforts. We remain committed to our mission of nurturing
confident life-long learners and compassionate contributors with a deep
connection to the Chinese culture. Our school motto, 敦品励学, exalts our pupils
to be steadfast in character and possess a thirst for knowledge. As an
SAP school, it is important for us to immerse our pupils in an environment
rich in Chinese culture and language to develop effectively bilingual pupils,
who will serve the community and nation in the future. We aim to equip
our pupils with the dispositions and attributes to be active citizens who
have a global outlook and embrace cultural diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, we saw the fruits of our re-envisioning exercise, with our refreshed
mission and strategic plan taking root. We are proud to share that our
focus on enhancing pupil well-being through a caring and enabling environment,
and developing compassionate contributing leaders anchored in values has
yielded positive outcomes. Our staff, the anchors of our school, have embraced
opportunities for collective growth and competency building.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, we aim to further strengthen our holistic approach
to education. We will continue to provide varied learning experiences that
inspire our pupils to be motivated learners, innovative problem solvers,
and compassionate contributors anchored in our core values of Respect,
Resilience, Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence.</p>
<p>This year, we plan to strengthen the development of our pupils’ 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies through our key programmes such as our Applied Learning Programme,
Project Work and Experiential Learning Week. We will also continue to emphasise
the inculcation of school values and socio-emotional competencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership between school and home remains crucial. We deeply appreciate
the trust and support of our parents in our endeavours to imbue important
values and provide a well-rounded education for all Maha Bodhians. We look
forward to continuing our close collaboration with all stakeholders as
we nurture our pupils and enable them to soar to greater heights. Maha
Bodhi School remains committed to being a school of choice, distinction
and pride, striving to provide a holistic education for our pupils to make
a difference in their lives and communities.</p>
<p>Together, with one united heart and mind, we can achieve more in 2025
and beyond.</p>
<p>May I wish all a happy and fulfilling 2025.</p>
<p>May you and your loved ones be well and happy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>With warm regards,
<br>Mrs See Lai Kwan
<br>Principal</p>

<p><strong>2025 校长献词</strong>
</p>
<p>在我们迎接新的一年之际，我们对菩提学校的未来充满乐观和期待。过去的一年是反思和成长的一年，我们在先驱学校领导、教职人员、学生和合作伙伴奠定的基础上不断进步。</p>
<p>我校的愿景"品德高尚的乐学者"继续指引着我们,致力培养心系华夏文化且自信的终身学习者和怀有慈悲心的贡献者。我校校训"敦品励学"激励着我们的学生坚定品格，保持求知欲。作为特选学校，我们认为让学生沉浸在丰富的中华文化和语言环境中至关重要，以培养能在未来服务社区和国家的双语人才。我们的目标是培养具有全球视野、接纳文化多元性的积极公民。</p>
<p>2024年，我们在更新我校的宗旨与策略方针中开始结出硕果。我们通过打造一个有利于学生全面发展且充满关爱的环境来提升学生福祉，并培育以道德为基础且心怀慈悲的贡献者。这些努力都取得了积极成果。我校教职人员为学校的支柱，积极把握集体成长和能力建设的机会。</p>
<p>展望2025年，我们旨在进一步加强制造一个全方位学习的教育环境。我们将继续提供多样化的学习体验，激发学生成为积极，自主的学习者、具有以创新手法面对问题的解决者和心怀慈悲心的贡献者。这些都植根于我们的核心价值观：尊重、坚韧、正直、仁爱和卓越。今年，我们计划通过应用式学习计划、项目作业和体验式学习周等重点项目，加强学生21世纪技能的培养。我们还将继续强调学校价值观和社交和情绪管理技能的培养。</p>
<p>学校与家庭之间的伙伴关系仍然至关重要。我们深深感谢家长们对我们的信任和支持，让我们能够为所有菩提学子灌输重要价值观并提供全面教育。树人与育人是教育使命的重中之重。期望在教育部、佛教总会、校友会和家长会的鼎立支持下，加上家长伙伴的信任及教职团队全心全力的付出，菩提的孩子们都能在学习的道路上茁壮成长，在学业上和全人的发展上获得成就！</p>
<p>让我们团结一心，在2025年及取得更大的成就。</p>
<p>祝欢喜吉祥，如意安康！</p>
<p>邓丽君校长谨启</p>
