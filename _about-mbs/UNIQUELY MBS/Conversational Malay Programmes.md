## Conversational Malay Programmes

The Conversational Malay Programme (CMP) was introduced in Maha Bodhi School in 2008. It is targeted at Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils. The programme aims to develop the student’s ability to speak and understand simple conversational Malay. They will learn the basic sentence structure and the basic vocabulary for everyday situations.

By the end of the programme, our students should be able to:

*   Listen to and understand simple spoken Malay language
*   Ask and answer questions, using simple Malay language
*   Show an awareness and appreciation of Malay culture.

The school engaged external Malay instructors to conduct the programme. They used various teaching strategies to engage our pupils such as quizzes, sing-along sessions, dialogue and role play. Through such activities, our pupils have the opportunity to learn a little more about Malay culture in an engaging and fun way.

34 pupils went on a Learning Journey to Kampong Glam on 17 November 2015. The Learning Journey aims to create pupil’s awareness to Malay Culture through introduction to Malay Cuisine and Lifestyle. Our pupils had a hands-on session of ondeh-ondeh making. For most of them, it was the first time and it was definitely an eye-opening experience for them.
