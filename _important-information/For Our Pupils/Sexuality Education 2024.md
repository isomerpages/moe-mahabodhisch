<h2><strong>Maha Bodhi School</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>
