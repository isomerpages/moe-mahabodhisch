### 5\. Arrival Procedures 

Pupils walking or taking public transport to school should enter the school via Gate A or Gate B from 6.30am to 7.20am.

Gate 2 will be opened from 6.50am to 7.15am to allow parents /guardians to drive into the school compound to alight their child/ward at the drop off point at the Block G. Parents/Guardians are to exit via Gate 3 after dropping off their child/ward.

Parents/Guardians are reminded to alight their child/ward at the demarcated drop-off boxes only, and not anywhere else along the driveway. Parents/guardians are to strictly adhere to directions from staff on duty. To ensure safety and minimise traffic congestion, parents/guardians can only do a&nbsp;**LEFT TURN**&nbsp;into the school compound. Right turn from the opposite side of the road is not allowed.

### 6\. Dismissal Procedure 

**Dismissal : Pupils fetched by parents/guardians/elder siblings**

Parents/Guardians of P1 and P2 pupils are to enter the school via Gate B and wait at the Basketball Court. Due to security concerns, Gate B will be opened from 1.05pm to 1.45pm (Monday to Friday).&nbsp;

Teachers will lead pupils to the Basketball Court for dismissal. For P3 pupils who are going home with their P1/P2/P4 siblings, they are to proceed to Basketball Court (BBC) to meet them. As for P3 pupils who are going home with their P5/P6 siblings, they are to proceed to Gazebo to meet them.

To ensure the safety of pedestrians and pupils using Gate B, the school buses will leave the school premises after 1.45pm (Monday to Friday) via Gate 3. As such we urge parents/guardians to leave the school compound with their child/ward as soon as their child/ward arrives at the Basketball Court.

Parents/Guardians of P1 and P2 pupils who are late in fetching their child/ward (after 1.40pm on Monday to Friday) are to proceed to the Gazebo. Our teachers will lead the remaining pupils to the Gazebo to wait for parents/guardians who are late. Parents/Guardians will not be allowed to enter from Gate B after 1.45pm (Monday to Friday).

Dismissal for P3 to P6 pupils will be at the Gate A. Parents/Guardians of P3 to P6 pupils are to wait at the HDB void deck near the pedestrian crossing opposite the school.

**Dismissal : Pupils fetched by parents/guardians who drive**

We encourage parents/guardians to park their vehicles at the HDB car park and wait there to pick up their child/ward from P3 to P6 to avoid obstruction to vehicular traffic. Parking along the road is not allowed as it is considered a traffic offence.

To prevent overcrowding and to facilitate the dismissal of our P3 to P6 via Gate A in an orderly manner,&nbsp;**parents/guardians of P1 and P2 pupils who drive are to arrive after 1.45pm (Monday to Friday) to fetch your child/ward from Gate 1 to prevent traffic congestion during peak dismissal period.**&nbsp;The pupils will wait in front of the General Office or at the Gazebo.

**Dismissal : Pupils taking the school buses**

Pupils taking school buses will report to the bus bay for attendance-taking. Buses will leave after 1.45pm (Monday to Friday) once all the pupils have boarded the buses.

**Dismissal : Pupils awaiting for external student care service providers**

Pupils waiting for external student care service providers will do so at the respective designated waiting areas.
