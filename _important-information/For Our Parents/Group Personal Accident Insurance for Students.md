## Group Personal Accident Insurance for Students


Our school has taken up the Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance for Students with NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited. The plan provides coverage to our pupils for school-related activities both within and beyond our school. This scheme is provided at no cost to our students as the payment of the premium is borne by our school.

To submit an insurance claim for your child, please visit the GPA portal at [https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg](https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/)
