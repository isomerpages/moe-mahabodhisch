## Self-Responsibility for Personal Belongings

Besides nurturing academic excellence, we also focus on building character excellence through instilling discipline and responsibility in our pupils. As such, we would like to seek your support in our effort in developing our children to take responsibility for their own belongings. You can encourage them to pack their personal belongings and stationery according to the timetable into their bag every night before going to bed. We seek your help to tell your child/ward to adopt the following suggestions if he/she forgets to bring the items:

1)      Pupils can inform their teachers if they forget to bring their files/books and pupils can bring them the next day to submit to their teachers.

2)      Pupils can inform their teachers if they forget to bring their pocket money for the day OR they can approach the General Office for snacks (biscuits)

3)      Pupils can drink from the water coolers along the corridors, outside toilets or at the canteen if they forgot to bring their water bottles.

We will only be delivering urgent and important items or messages. We seek your strong support and partnership in this initiative to develop responsibility in our pupils. We also appeal to support the school’s efforts and respect our staff when they decline your request to pass items to your child/ward.
