## Guidelines for School- Home Partnership

Ministry of Education (MOE) believes that our children succeed when parents and schools work hand in hand. To help clarify the nature of this partnership, MOE has developed a set of practices for schools and parents to partner each other to support their childrenâ€™s education in a balanced and meaningful manner.

The two guiding principles for school-home partnership are:

*   Students succeed when schools and parents work hand in hand to support students in learning self-management skills, taking responsibility and building resilience.
*   Mutual respect and trust form the strong foundation for positive engagement between schools and parents.

The attached listicle provides an overview of the Guidelines for School-Home Partnership.
