## Payment via GIRO


Besides school and miscellaneous fees, you can also opt to use the same GIRO account to pay for your child’s/ward’s enrichment programmes and school charges. The amounts will be net of Edusave deductions if you have authorized the Edusave standing orders for school fees and enrichment programmes.

This GIRO instruction will carry on if your child/ward remains in a Government or Government Aided primary school, secondary school or junior college.

The schedule for the various types of deductions are as follows :

| School Fees                                                                                                                                                | Enrichment Programmes and School Charges                                                                                                        |   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| 26th of each month from February to December<br><br> <br>If 26th falls on weekend or public holiday, deductions will be made on the next working day.<br>  | 6th of each month from March to December<br><br> <br>If 6th falls on weekend or public holiday, deductions will be made on the next working day |   |

If there are any charges overpaid by your child/ward, the credit balance will be used to offset future fees payable in the same academic year. Any excess credit balance (after offsetting future fees) will then be refunded to this GIRO account by the end of the following month.
