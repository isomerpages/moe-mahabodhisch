## Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme 

If your child is accompanying you on an overseas posting, you may apply for the Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme which allows your child to rejoin the school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of Maha Bodhi School. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child’s  return:

*   **Administrative**: Renewal of LOA, returning arrangements, updates on important dates for admissions exercises, etc.
*   **Academic**: Major test and examination papers with answers, where appropriate, on a regular basis, and access to [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space) portal that enables your child to keep up-to-date with our national curriculum.
*   **Relationship**: Developments in the school and local education scene.

To apply, please complete the online application form at [https://go.gov.sg/mbs-loa](https://go.gov.sg/mbs-loa)
