## Payment via Edusave


For students studying in a MOE-funded school, they can use the Edusave funds for :

*   2nd\-tier miscellaneous fees
*   Enrichment programmes organized by the school (both local and overseas)

To use your child’s/ward’s Edusave funds for enrichment programmes, you can opt to sign up for the Standing Order Form authorizing the school to withdraw funds from your child’s/ward’s Edusave account. This one-time Edusave withdrawal authorization will remain valid throughout your child’s/ward’s school years.

The school will continue to inform and seek your consent for your child’s/ward’s participation before the withdrawal of Edusave funds. If you subsequently decide that you do not want to use your child’s/ward’s Edusave Account to co-pay for enrichment programmes, you can terminate the Standing Order at any time.

How to apply

*   Please submit the online [Standing Order Form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5be24a1bb3f842000fdc4e59) with either parent’s SingPass login.
