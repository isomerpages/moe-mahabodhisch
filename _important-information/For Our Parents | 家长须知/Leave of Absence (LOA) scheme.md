<h2>Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme</h2>
<p>If your child is accompanying you on an overseas posting, you may apply
for the Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme which allows your child to rejoin
the school after they return from overseas.</p>
<p>If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student
of Maha Bodhi School. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly
after returning to Singapore.</p>
<p>The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child’s&nbsp;
return:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Administrative</strong>: Renewal of LOA, returning arrangements,
updates on important dates for admissions exercises, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>

where appropriate, on a regular basis, and access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Learning Space (SLS)</a>&nbsp;portal
that enables your child to keep up-to-date with our national curriculum.</p>
