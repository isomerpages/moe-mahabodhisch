## Health Promotion Board (HPB) Series

HPB is launching a series of educational articles for parents, which include topics such as nutrition, physical activity, mental wellness and even sleep!

These articles are specifically curated to guide parents on healthy tricks and treats to guide them in their daily activities with their children.

We hope that parents and our pupils will benefit from reading these articles. You can look forward to more articles in the months ahead.

**HPB Educational Articles**

The first two articles are **(1) Managing Transition** and **(2) Sleep.** These articles aim to help parents learn the right skills, lifestyle habit changes during the transition phase, and important sleep tips.

The June school holidays are just around the corner and it’s timely for parents to start planning for holiday activities. Parents looking for fun and healthy activities for families can join the Health Promotion Board’s _The Healthy Timeout Challenge_ and be active as a family everyday!
