<h4><strong>2024 Chinese New Year Celebration&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>2025 Chinese New Year Celebration</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our continual effort to imbue in our pupils the importance
of Chinese culture and traditions,</p>
<p>we will be celebrating Lunar New Year on <strong>28 January 2025 (Tuesday)</strong> as
one big Maha Bodhi family from <strong>7.30am to 10.30am </strong>on that
day.</p>
<p>In celebration of the festival, the school will be closed immediately
after pupils’ dismissal to allow our dedicated staff to spend quality time
with their families. As such, we kindly request that former pupils refrain
from visiting teachers on that day.</p>
<p>However, recognizing the festive spirit and the desire of pupils to reconnect
with their teachers, we</p>
<p>have designated a special period for such visits. If former pupils wish
to visit their teachers, we warmly welcome them to do so between on <strong>3rd - 4th February 2025.</strong>
</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth and secure visit, we kindly request former pupils to
inform their respective</p>
<p>teachers of the intended date and time of their visit. This will enable
our protection officers to be</p>
<p>adequately informed in advance, ensuring the safety and comfort of all
parties involved.</p>
<p>作为特选学校，菩提一向注重弘扬华族传统文化。值此新春佳节来临之际，本校将在</p>

<p>庆祝会当天，学校将在所有学生离开后关闭，以让全体教职员回家与家人庆祝节日。因</p>
<p>此，若校友想要回学校向老师们拜年，可以在<strong>2025年2月3日至2月4</strong>日这段期间里，与老师安排时间，回校向老师送上新年祝福。</p>
