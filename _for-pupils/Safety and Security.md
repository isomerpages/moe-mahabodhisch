the school also need to balance this visits with school programmes and
bear in mind the safety of all.Former pupils visiting the school will only
be allowed entry to the school premises after most of our students are
dismissed ie 30 mins after official dismissal time. Details will be provided
in the notification for visits on Maha Bodhi School’s website and outside
main gate 2 weeks prior to the day. Former pupils must don existing secondary
/ JC school uniforms. Those not wearing school uniforms are to sign in
at the Security Counter. After the entry to the school, they are to wait
in classroom E1-1 for their teachers.</p>
