## From Our Parents

**#20**

I’ll would like to thank Ms Tan Miao Ling for her help and encouragement during this period. She has been very prompt in her marking and has been giving timely feedback during HBL. She resolved our technical issues even when I message her at night. We are glad to have her back with the class. Keep up with the good work!

Dear Ms Liew, 陈老师, Mr Loh, Mr Ng, Mr Zul, Mdm Huzailinda and Ms Eoh

Home-based Learning (HBL) lasting for exactly 4 weeks has finally come to an end today!  It has been a very trying period for all – coping with work from home (teachers and parents), handling children who are on HBL (where applicable) and other daily chores in addition to keeping ourselves abreast with our country’s COVID-19 situation.

In these 4 weeks, I have seen:

*   Miss Liew come online for Hey! Time and prepare videos/lessons for the Class
*   陈老师 for conducting classes over Zoom every lesson without fail
*   Mr Loh for conducting lessons over Google Meet/Zoom too and having “meeting room” opened for individual students to seek consultations where they need more help (I guess I am the most over-aged student to attend 2 of such individual consultation sessions ;P)
*   Mr Ng and the Science Department with videos/lessons prepared for whole level (Wo!  I learnt from these video lessons too as Berwin was asked to go through them with me as if I was a student after school hours – it made him feel accomplished to be teaching his Mummy 😉 ) and Mr Ng conducting consultation session for students who need clarification too
*   Mr Zul and the PE Department for PE lessons conducted through recorded videos …. My!  Should see how my floor trembled when Berwin followed each exercise step diligently.  I am thankful for understanding neighbours who did not come and knock on our door ;P
*   Mdm Huzailinda and Ms Eoh and the Art & Music Department for Art & Music lessons done through recorded videos …. I am sure the teachers know the students really love such lessons J

As the HBL comes to an end, I will like to put on record our **APPRECIATION** again to all the above-mentioned **TEACHERS** who are directly coaching Berwin and his classmates in 5I/5CL10, as well as all teachers in the various Departments as I can see how the Department actually comes together to support each other – a time when we see synergies from collaborated efforts.

Same appreciation has to go to the **ADMINISTRATIVE and NON-TEACHING STAFF** in Maha Bodhi School.  We received promptly various notifications sent via Parents Gateway including latest updates to HBL and the various parts of Parents Kit for HBL – they are certainly helpful reminders on how to keep our children engaged constructively and maintain the sanity of parents 😉

Last but not least, we would like to thank Mrs Quek, Mrs Yeo and the **SCHOOL MANAGEMENT** for their leadership and the various initiatives to help the children continue to learn beyond the textbooks, such as the Screening of Local Production – Wa is for Wayang and Wayang Boy so far.  They are certainly good shows for some meaningful family bonding time.

Mid-year school holidays being brought forward is certainly an applaudable decision by MOE.  The Teachers and the School Management all **DESERVE** a break after 4 gruelling weeks of meetings, lesson planning, preparation and conducting lessons on a new media.  Please have a **GOOD REST** and “**RECUPERATE**” well! The children certainly look forward to returning to school to see all in good shape J.  Once again, OUR **SALUTE** to you, TEACHERS and ALL STAFF of Maha Bodhi School!

陈老师

4个星期的居家学习时段终于在今天圆满结束了。 在这4个星期里，老师没有间断地通过Zoom给孩子们上课，讲解课文，词语，布置听/默写等等， 老师辛苦了!

非常感谢老师们这4个星期的辛劳，准备/修改教材以便通过新媒介教授课程。

所幸教育部做了个明智的决定 – 让年中的一个月学校假期提前到5月5日开始。  老师们终于有个喘气的机会，利用这个假期好好放松一下，补充4个星期因成倍的付出而流失的能量 J。 务请陈老师及所有老师们好好休息，“充电”！ 期待孩子们六月能顺利回返学校与老师同学们相聚，共同学习。

再次对菩提学校的所有老师和领导们的付出表示**感恩**，并希望大家能有个**轻松愉悦的学校假期**！

Once again, **THANK YOU**

We would like to convey our heartfelt appreciation to all the staffs of MBS, especially the Principals and Teachers for putting in so much effort in ensuring a smooth transition to FHBL.

A huge thanks to Mr. Chan (FT), Mr. Low (FT), Mr. Ng (EL), 林老师 (CL), we are so gratefully for your patience and dedication to your job every day. You have been doing the important job – educating the next generation despite the Covid-19 global pandemic. Thank you for the precious efforts in constant check of the children’s’ homework, as well as the learning packages for FHBL that were uploaded in the SLS.

We understand teachers had to completely adjust the way how you teach our children, and giving our children necessary support from home each and every day during this difficult time, while dealing with enormous amount of stress on a daily basis, as a parent. Thankfully, lessons can continue, almost as per normal.

Thanks for having the “HEY Time” which allows the children to meet each other online apart from the official zoom time for lessons, so they are able to stay connected with their friends.

Thank you for everything you do! You all are doing a great job, your contribution is appreciated. Please stay safe and healthy everyone!

Thank you teachers for the hard work during this period. It is really a short time to muster the skills to “teach” online and trying to make sure the kids learn as well. It’s not easy. Greatly appreciated it.

Thank Mrs Quek, teachers and staff of MBS. During this difficult time for everyone, we are grateful for the dedication, efforts and passion of all the teachers and staff. They have worked very hard in delivering lessons not only to ensure the students keep up with the curriculum but also to enjoy the home-based learning lessons. We are grateful and reminded that most of the teachers not only have to conduct zoom lessons, prepare materials and guide the students from different levels, they too have to take care of their own children who require assistance in solving technology challenges and guidance in their school work. We are hopeful that this period will help parents be more appreciative for the collaborative work needed between the school & family to establish an encouraging and continuous learning process for our children. Thank you teachers! #SGUnited

It is not easy for everyone to come together to meet up at HBL to make it a successful session without everyone’s joint effort, from the teachers to the backend support staff. Thank you for preparing for the necessary materials needed for the HBL. Thank you Mrs. Liu, Mr Zul and 苏老师 for doing constant checks to make sure that the kids are submitting their homework. A BIG Thank you for making sure that the kids are not deprived of the chance of learning during this period. Really appreciate. Stay healthy! \_/\\\_

Dear MBS Principal Mrs Quek and Teachers, A Big Big Thank You to the school,  your teaching, time and efforts in making the HBL (lesson planning and recordings) possible for our child. This is not an easy journey but we have all made it. Teachers have gone the extra mile and put in extra hours to check on the kid’s individual well-being thru the Zoom meetings, as well as personal message to check on his learning progress. Thank you- Mrs Liu, Mr Zul and Mrs Soh! Jia you!

Appreciating principals and teachers for their efforts and working out of their comfort zones in coordinating and utilising the various technology teachings during this difficult period. It is not easy to manage pupils’ and parents’ queries at the same time daily, plus preparing the lessons and marking the homework.

A big thumbs up for all their hard works and sending regards to all!

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 🌻🌻🌻

Stay Well, Stay Safe And Stay Healthy. Thank you so much for all of you did for us ! 🙏🙏🙏

I would like to say a big THANK YOU to Mr James Lee, Mrs Wong and 马老师 for their dedicated work in guiding my boy in his HBL learning. It means so much to him because he is able to stay connected with his teachers and friends. Thanks to all his teachers, he is managing his HBL lessons in a comfortable pace. Teachers, please take care of your health as well and stay safe. We really appreciate all the hard work which you all had put in during this difficult time.

A big shout out to all the teachers of 5 Generosity for helping my son, Jarius Lim to quickly adapt and continue to learn through HBL!

We can see the efforts that the English teacher, Mrs Wong and Chinese Teacher, Mdm Soh put into the hbl packages!…. Both teachers take special time and care to ensure the kids submit in their work and mark with care through online submission and feedback.

A big shout out to Mr Lee (5G’s form, Maths and Science teacher) for his detailed Maths and Science teaching videos and daily zoom live lessons which allow Jarius to easily keep pace with his Maths and Science learning and giving him immediate feedback to close his learning loop! I think he doesn’t get the chance to miss Mr Lee and his friends as they are zooming daily!

We understand that teachers are equally overwhelmed by the hbl and you have your own family and kids too! Thus, we are even more appreciative of the time and effort the teachers put in! Much appreciated! Thanks!!

I want to take this opportunity to thank all the teachers and staff in MBS. I’m an ex-student of MBS and I’m always proud to be in MBS. Seeing my 2 children growing up and studying in MBS with so many patient and encouraging teachers made me even more appreciative and grateful.

A very big thank you to Mrs Chan, 黄老师, Mrs Wong from 2K, Mrs Yeo and 施老师,from 5A for their patience and assistance in providing us the steps to use the zoom, Google meet etc and reminders for the children to submit their homework. During the zoom or Google meet, can see that all the kids missed their friends and teachers! Thank you once again to all MBS teachers and staff for the hard work during this period! Let’s all stay Healthy and safe! 感恩 🙏

A big shout out to all the teachers of 3 Humility for helping my son, Javen Lim to quickly adapt and continue to learn through HBL! We can see the efforts that the English teacher, Ms Kiran, Chinese Teacher, Mdm Lim, and Science teacher, Mr Ong, put into the hbl packages!…. Special thanks to form teacher, Mr Ang for his detailed Maths teaching videos which allow Javen to keep pace with his Maths learning and crafting recess packages with interesting activities for my boy to relax a little too!

We understand that teachers are equally overwhelmed by the hbl and you have your own family and kids too! Thus, we are even more appreciative of the time and effort that the teachers put in! Much appreciated! Thanks!!

I would like to thank all my kids’ super teachers (Mr James Lee – super awesome zoom math and science classes for Justin), Mrs Wong, He Lao Shi, Mr Chan, Mr Ng (awesome sharing on how to encourage love of English) and both Mr Ng and Mr Chan (for making sure everyone starts at 8am sharp!), Mr Ian Ang and Yang Lao Shi, Madam Asrina and Madam Jin Lu (checking submission even at midnight and weekends).

Thank you, MBS for Wa for Wayang movie. All my kids (even my k1) enjoyed so much! Looking forward to next week’s movie!

Kudos to the Principals and Teachers for putting in so much effort ensuring a smooth transition to HBL. I know that there’s a lot of hard work behind the scenes in order to make this happen. Special shout-out to Mrs Yeo and 陈老师 for the interactive engagement and guidance through Class Dojo and WhatsApp. Thanks for your commitment despite this challenging environment! Let’s stay safe and sane and overcome this as #oneunitedMBS

Dear Teachers, I know you are trying your best to get the HBL going. As we are getting into the momentum, I know you are also trying to add more teaching materials such as meaningful videos and short films. I know it’s not easy to zoom in and zoom out between classes. We really appreciate all these face to face meeting efforts, no matter how short the time is. This is a unique situation and will be a memorable experience for all of us. We are learning along the way. A Big THANK YOU to Team Maha Bodhi School!!!

Thank you for taking the extra mile to make the lessons fun and interesting! I am grateful. Let us stay safe and we are in this together!

**_Letter of Appreciation_**

_I understand that the teachers need to adjust to home-based learning and the work load might not seem any lighter. Teachers have got the tough jobs and their rewards are limited to the hope that their wisdom will make a difference in the lives of our children, helping them to be better beings._

During these tough times, the class teachers have been very supportive and understanding when the children are unable to submit their work on time or unable to attend Zoom sessions. More importantly, the teachers gave the children a lesson on social-emotional lesson. They went an extra mile of sending us messages to remind us of the submission of homework, timing of Zoom meeting and answering the children/our questions patiently.

I was attending one of the sessions hosted by Yu Hang’s CL teacher this morning and I overheard the teacher explaining and encouraging the class to do their best to complete they work independently as parents are working from home. She went on sharing with them the adjustment that we, as parents, have to make and they should show appreciation by getting their work done independently.

The children are truly fortunate to have teachers who care for them.
