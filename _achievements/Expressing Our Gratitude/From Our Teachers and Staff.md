Dear 2 Excellence,  
I have learned from you as much as you have allowed me to teach you. Learning is a collaborative activity when it is happening at its best. We leverage each others strengths to overcome our own challenges. Teaching has challenged me to acknowledge my shortcomings and provided me countless outlets for exploring new adventures. I have so much gratitude for every one of you who has played a role in that experience.

Make sure to take time to reflect and always move forward. Your learning is about you and no one else.  
Make sure to take advantage of every learning opportunity that is placed in your path.  
I am thankful to Zoom. Technology is great for keeping relationships current. The more I see you onZoom, the more I miss you.

Have an awesome holiday. Rest. Enjoy what you do.

Warm regards,  
Ms Oh, 24 April

Dear Parents of 2 Excellence,

I appreciate the values you have imbibed upon your child. With your support and encouragement, you child submits his/her SLS HBL online work in a timely manner. You reach out to me in various forms of online submissions of work. You are willing to provide the IT support because you want to ensure your child has that sense of achievement in task fulfillment at home. Your values and work ethics at home are praiseworthy.

Thank you for your patience, support and understanding as you journey with your child in their HBL learning. Thank you for showing the support and encouragement to get a Zoom account though it was the first time that you use this videoconferencing platform, Zoom. Thank you for juggling between work and family commitments and ensure that your child joins every Zoom lesson with me or Mrs Teo. Thank you for helping your child to be a self-disciplined and determined learner at home. Appreciate your partnership in the well-being and learning of your child at home.

Warm regards,

Ms Oh, 24 April

To Annie, Pei Yi and Siow Chin, 

I appreciate you taking the time out of your busy day to help me with the SLS features and functions on a Saturday afternoon.

After spending two hours trying to insert a picture onto a multi-choice question on SLS, I could not get it. At the same time, I tried to embed a PowerPoint slide and remove the audio recording on SLS, I failed to do it too.

At that time of moment, my own light gradually went out and I was on the verge of crying. I called you and my light was rekindled by a spark from you. Pei Yi and Siow Chin guided me step-by-step via videoconferencing. Pei Yi told me she called me a few times once HBL started officially. She was concerned how I was coping with HBL. I was very moved. 

Annie continued to guide me patiently although she has to juggle her work and family commitments. I was deeply touched by her time and effort. Siow Chin also juggled between work and family. She continued to give me unwavering support and encouragement in IT related matters.

Thank you for caring and supporting me wholeheartedly. I could not have completed the P3 SLS lesson plan without your support and guidance. I count my blessings to have such caring colleagues. The role you play in my life is immeasurable. Thank you for being there for me always.

Warm regards, 

Dom, 24 April

I am very grateful to Annie, Shaz and Theng Wai for providing me the crash courses yesterday afternoon. They taught me patiently how to get a user account and how to carry out videoconferencing with parents. Without their guidance and enthusiasm, I will not be able to connect with 2E via zoom this morning. They went the extra mile to help me despite their busy schedule. Their efforts are very much appreciated. I am very thankful that the SLS platform is a platform in which lesson ideas are shared and pupils benefit from a wider range of resources. It helps to make an attempt to strengthen my IT skills as best as I can.

I am thankful to have supportive, positive and understanding School Leaders who gave us the confidence to proceed on with HBL without any major concerns. The positive mind sets of our School Leaders help us to fight on despite fears in our hearts that there is uncertainty now.
