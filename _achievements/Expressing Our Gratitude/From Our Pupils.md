I would like to say a big THANK YOU to Mr James Lee, Mrs Wong and 马老师 for their dedicated work in guiding my boy in his HBL learning. It means so much to him because he is able to stay connected with his teachers and friends. Thanks to all his teachers, he is managing his HBL lessons in a comfortable pace. Teachers, please take care of your health as well and stay safe. We really appreciate all the hard work which you all had put in during this difficult time.

I want to take this opportunity to thank all the teachers and staff in MBS. I’m an ex student from MBS and I’m always proud to be in MBS. Seeing my 2 children growing up and studying in MBS with so many patient and encouraging teachers made me to be more appreciative and grateful. A very big thank you to Mrs Chan, 黄老师, Mrs Wong from 2K, Mrs Yeo and 施老师,from 5A for their patience and assistance in providing us the steps to use the zoom, Google meet etc and reminders for the children and parents to submit their homework. During the zoom or Google meet, can see that all the kids missed their friends and teachers! Thank you once again to all MBS teachers and staff for the hard work during this period! Let’s all stay Healthy and safe! 感恩 🙏

A big shout out to all the teachers of 5 Generosity for helping my son, Jarius Lim to quickly adapt and continue to learn through HBL! We can see the efforts that the English teacher, Mrs Wong and Chinese Teacher, Mdm Soh put into the hbl packages!…. Both teachers take special time and care to ensure the kids submit in their work and mark with care through online submission and feedback. A big shout out to Mr Lee (5G’s form, Maths and Science teacher) for his detailed Maths and Science teaching videos and daily! =0 zoom live lessons which allow Jarius to easily keep pace with his Maths and Science learning and giving him immediate feedback to close his learning loop! I think he doesn’t get the chance to miss Mr Lee and his friends as they are zooming daily! We understand that teachers are equally overwhelmed by the hbl and have your own family and kids too! Thus, we are all the more appreciative of the time and effort the teachers put in! Much appreciated! Thanks!!

Dear MBS Principal Mrs Quek and Teachers, A Big Big Thank You to the school, your teaching, time and efforts in making the HBL (lesson planning and recordings) possible for our child. This is not an easy journey but we have all made it. Teachers have gone the extra mile to extra hours, check on the kid’s individual well being thru the Zoom meetings, as well as personal message to check on his learning progress. Thank you- Mrs Liu, Mr Zul and Mrs Soh! Jia you!

Thank Mrs Quek, teachers and staff of MBS. During this difficult time for everyone, we are grateful for the dedication, efforts and passion of all the teachers and staff. They have worked very hard in delivering lessons not only to ensure the students keep up with the curriculum but also to enjoy the home-based learning lessons. We are grateful and reminded that most of the teachers not only have to conduct zoom lessons, prepare materials and guide the students from different levels, they too have to take care of their own children who require assistance in solving technology challenges and guidance in their school work. We are hopeful that this period will help parents grow more appreciation for the collaborative work needed between the school & family to establish an encouraging and continuous learning process for our children. Thank you teachers! #SGUnited “Each day, teachers come to school ready to tackle a job that is critically important, extraordinarily complex, often joyful, and at times heartbreaking. In essence, teachers help others to become their best selves and I can think of no more important work” ~ Arne Duncan

Thank you teachers for the hard work during this period.It is really a short time to muster the skills to “teach” online and trying to make sure the kids learn as well. It’s not easy. Greatly appreciated it.

We would like to convey our heartfelt appreciation to all the staffs of MBS, especially the Principals and Teachers for putting in so much effort in ensuring a smooth transition to FHBL. A huge thanks to Mr. Chan (FT), Mr. Low (FT), Mr. Ng (EL), 林老师 (CL), we are so gratefully for your patience and dedication to your job everyday. You have been doing the important job – educating the next generation despite the Covid-19 global pandemic. Thank you for the precious efforts in constant check of the children’s’ homework, as well as the learning packages for FHBL that uploaded in the SLS. We understand teachers had to completely adjust the way how you teach our children, and giving our children necessary support from home each and every day during this difficult time, while dealing with enormous amount of stress on a daily basis, as a parent. Thankfully, lessons can continue, almost as per normal. Thanks for having the “HEY Time” which allows the children to meet each other online apart from the official zoom time for lessons, so they are able to stay connected with their friends. Thank you for everything you do! You all are doing a great job, your contribution is appreciated. Please stay safe and healthy everyone! Parents of Jiong En (3 Faith).

Dear Teachers, I know you are trying your best to get the HBL going. As we are getting into the momentum, I know you are also trying to add more teaching materials such as meaningful videos and short films. I know it’s not easy to zoom in and zoom out between classes, we really appreciate all these face to face meeting efforts, no matter how little the time is. This is an unique situation, it will be a memorable experience for all of us, we are learning along the way. A Big THANK YOU to Team Maha Bodhi School!!!
