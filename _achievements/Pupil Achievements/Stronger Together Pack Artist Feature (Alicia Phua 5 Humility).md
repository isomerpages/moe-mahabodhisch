[Artist's Feature Alicia Phua Singapore Together Pack](/files/Artists-Feature-Alicia-Phua-Singapore-Together-Pack.pdf)

We extend our heartiest congratulations to Alicia Phua Shi Yin from 5 Humility! Her artwork titled “Our United Singapore” was selected for this year’s NDP 2020 Singapore Together Pack. We are proud that Alicia’s artwork was selected as one of the 20 designs for the Singapore Together Pack to reflect on this moment of our history and look forward with renewed confidence and conviction.

The Singapore Together Pack is a roomy tote bag that can be folded into a compact size for easy storage. It can also be used as a grocery bag, promoting less reliance on single-use bags.

Kudos to Alicia for a job well done and our appreciation to her teachers for their guidance!
