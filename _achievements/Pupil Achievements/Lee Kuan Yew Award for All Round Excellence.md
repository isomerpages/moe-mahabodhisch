## Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence

We are proud that our pupil, Summer Renee Quek (Head Prefect, 2019), was awarded the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence (Primary) (LKY-ARE). She is one of the nine recipients of the award this year.Â 

LKY-ARE is a national level award for achievement in education. It recognises well-rounded students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and who exemplify the qualities articulated in our desired outcomes of education. We thank all teachers and staff who have contributed to mould Summer into a fine lady with exemplary character.
