<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for use of EdTech Resources Agreement</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. This Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) establishes guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech
resources to help you understand how to use these resources safely and
responsibly, in line with efforts to develop your digital literacies and
growth as digitally responsible citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning devices
(e.g. Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), school devices)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICT system accounts
(e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), iCON); and school internet
networks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For more information, please refer to:</p>
<p>Student Kit on Cyber Wellness and Learning with a Learning Device (Primary)
– <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/cw-studentkitpri</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>All Maha Bodhians must strive to be future-ready, responsible digital
learners. Maha Bodhians need to be aware of one’s responsibilities towards
oneself and others. Exercise care. Stop and think before one act. Learning
devices are used to support one’s learning in school and internet access
allows one to share resources and interact with people from all over the
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To ensure that all pupils have a safe, conducive online learning experience,
please abide by the following rules when using any computing device in
the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Maha Bodhians:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>General</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should not attempt to access
data, system and information that you are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reminded that the use of learning
devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose
of learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should interact with others in
a respectful and responsible way. I should not post online remarks that
are</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; racially and/or religiously
insensitive,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vulgar and/or offensive,
or</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hurtful to others.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should not use any devices to</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; store, modify, create
or share content (e.g. documents, presentations, pictures and videos) that
is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic, defamatory, hurtful to self
or others).</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make threats, cause
harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate others.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should not use MOE/school-deployed
ICT system accounts for any commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling
of goods and services).</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should obey the terms of use
of social medial platforms use (e.g. WhatsApp requires users to be at least
13 years old.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance
with the school’s discipline policy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Respecting Copyright</strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reminded to obtain explicit
permission from the content owner(s) before downloading, copying or sharing
any copyrighted materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I should not use, copy, edit
or share digital files in an unauthorised or illegal manner.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must ensure that you meet the
minimum age requirement specified in each AI tool's age restrictions before
using it.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the use of AI is permitted, I should acknowledge
the use of AI in weighted assessments and homework as required.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am to practise academic integrity and be responsible
for my own learning when using AI. Understand that I am ultimately short-changing
myself if I pass off other’s work as my own.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Staying Safe and Secure online</strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should report any incidents (e.g. unusual device
behaviour or inappropriate use of devices), to the school.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reminded to develop online safety habits. This
includes not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password
etc.), sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords) online or
on AI platforms, verifying credibility of online content before sharing,
avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, and
being cautious when interacting with others online (e.g. on social media)
by not engaging with strangers.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should exercise caution regarding the limitations
of AI tools, including potential inaccuracies / fabricated responses, inherent
biases and outdated information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Digital Wellbeing and Balance</strong>
</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reminded to balance screentime with other activities
including physical exercise and face-to-face social interactions.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should avoid excessive use of my devices outside
learning hours.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should take regular breaks to rest my eyes and
mind.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reminded to practise good sleep hygiene by
not using my devices one hour before bedtime.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school staff may take photographs or video images during curriculum
time or school activities, and photographs or video images of your child/ward
may be captured. The school may use and publish such photographs or video
