<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Edition</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Building Strong Social Foundations: Nurturing Your Child's Social Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, we recognise that strong social skills form the
foundation for meaningful relationships and confident communication throughout
life. This edition focuses on practical strategies parents can use to support
their child's social development at home, from building positive interaction
skills to nurturing empathy and respect for others' perspectives. Through
everyday moments and intentional activities, parents can help children
learn essential skills like sharing, turn-taking, and peaceful conflict
resolution. From engaging in board games that teach patience to encouraging
perspective-taking through thoughtful conversations, these approaches create
opportunities for growth in natural, supportive environments. Parents will
discover how simple actions like praising positive social behaviours and
role-modelling respectful communication can empower children to navigate
social situations with confidence and form lasting, meaningful connections
with others.</p>
