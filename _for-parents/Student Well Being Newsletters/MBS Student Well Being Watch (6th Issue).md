<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> Edition</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Digital Citizens: Navigating the Online World Safely</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, preparing students to thrive in our digital world
remains a cornerstone of our educational mission. This edition highlights
our Term 3 Cyber Wellness Week, where students engaged in meaningful activities
designed to build essential skills for navigating the online world safely
and responsibly. Through an engaging theatre performance that reimagined <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> for
the digital age and interactive recess stations, students discovered how
to become confident and caring digital citizens. From becoming cyber security
detectives to mastering online etiquette through fun challenges, our pupils
learned to protect themselves while spreading positivity in digital spaces.
Parents will find valuable resources and insights to continue these important
conversations at home, creating a unified approach to fostering healthy
digital habits and empowering the next generation of responsible online
citizens.</p>
