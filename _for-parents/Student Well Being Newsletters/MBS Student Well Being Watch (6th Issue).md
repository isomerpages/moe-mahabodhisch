<p><strong>Empowering Digital Citizens: Navigating the Online World Safely</strong>
</p>
<p>This edition of <em>Well-Being Watch</em> spotlights our schoolâ€™s Term 3
Cyber Wellness Week, where students took part in meaningful activities
that strengthened their ability to navigate the online world safely and
responsibly. From a theatre performance that reimagined <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> for
the digital age to interactive recess stations, students explored what
it means to be confident and caring digital citizens.</p>
<p>In this edition, parents will find resources and insights to continue
conversations at home, nurturing healthy digital habits and guiding the
next generation of responsible online users.</p>
