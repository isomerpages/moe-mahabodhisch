</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Digital Citizens: Navigating the Online World Safely</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, preparing students to thrive in our digital world
remains a cornerstone of our educational mission. This edition highlights
our Term 3 Cyber Wellness Week, where students engaged in meaningful activities
designed to build essential skills for navigating the online world safely
and responsibly. Through an engaging theatre performance that reimagined <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> for
the digital age and interactive recess stations, students discovered how
to become confident and caring digital citizens.</p>
<p>In this edition, parents will find valuable resources and insights to
continue these important conversations at home, creating a unified approach
to fostering healthy digital habits and empowering the next generation
of responsible online citizens.</p>
