<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Edition</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Together We Rise: Creating a Bully-Free School Community</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, fostering a culture of kindness, respect, and well-being
is central to all we do. This edition highlights our Well-Being (Bully-Free)
Week 2025, themed <strong>“Tease Me Not,”</strong> where students participated
in activities designed to strengthen friendships and nurture a caring school
community. Through interactive assembly programmes and six hands-on booth
activities, students learned to distinguish between teasing and bullying
while developing the skills to become upstanders. From <em>“Fish Out the Bullies”</em> games
to creating <em>Kindness Chatterboxes</em>, pupils explored how their words
and actions can positively impact others.</p>
<p>Parents will find insights on how these school initiatives reinforce values
that can be continued at home, supporting respectful relationships and
inclusive environments where every child feels they belong.</p>
