<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Edition</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Together We Rise: Creating a Bully-Free School Community</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, fostering a culture of kindness, respect, and well-being
remains at the heart of everything we do. This edition highlights our Well-Being
(Bully-Free) Week 2025, anchored on the theme "Tease Me Not," where students
engaged in meaningful activities designed to strengthen friendships and
build a caring community. Through interactive assembly programmes and six
engaging booth activities, students learned to distinguish between teasing
and bullying while developing essential skills to become upstanders. From
"Fish Out the Bullies" games to creating Kindness Chatterboxes, our pupils
discovered how their words and actions can make a positive difference.
Parents will discover how these school initiatives reinforce values that
can be continued at home, creating a unified approach to building respectful
relationships and inclusive environments where every child belongs.</p>
