</p>
<p><strong>Managing Screen Time: Supporting Your Child's Digital Well-Being</strong>
</p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, we understand that navigating today's digital landscape
presents both exciting opportunities and unique challenges for families.
This inaugural edition of Well-Being Watch introduces our new wellness
newsletter series, designed to equip parents with practical strategies
for supporting your child's overall well-being. As children spend increasing
amounts of time online, this edition focuses on effective screen time management
and cyber wellness practices that families can implement. From role-modelling
positive digital habits to creating family media plans and establishing
screen-free zones, parents will discover actionable approaches to help
children develop healthy relationships with technology. Coinciding with
Safer Internet Day, we encourage families to "Take a S.I.P" (Safer Internet
Pledge) together, reinforcing the importance of building safe and resilient
online communities where children can thrive digitally while maintaining
balance in their daily lives.</p>
