<p><strong>Supporting Children Through Bullying: A Parent's Guide</strong>
</p>
<p>Every parent faces that moment when their child comes home upset after
being teased at school. Is this normal childhood conflict, or something
more serious? Building on our previous Bully-Free Week activities that
promoted empathy and inclusion, this edition focuses on the crucial role
parents play in addressing bullying situations.</p>
<p>In this edition, we explore how to distinguish between hurtful behaviours
and bullying, and provide practical strategies for supporting children
whether they are experiencing bullying or displaying bullying behaviour
themselves. Using approaches like the C.H.E.E.R. method, providing emotional
support and strengthening children's social skills, parents learn to navigate
these challenging conversations with confidence.</p>
