<p><strong>Supporting Children Through Bullying: A Parent's Guide</strong>
</p>
<p>Children sometimes come home upset after being teased at school. How can
parents tell whether it is a simple disagreement or something more serious?
Building on our previous Bully-Free Week activities that promote empathy
and inclusion, this edition highlights the vital role parents play in addressing
bullying.</p>
<p>We explore how to distinguish hurtful behaviours from bullying and offer
practical strategies to support childrenâ€”whether they are experiencing
bullying or showing bullying behaviours themselves. By using approaches
like the C.H.E.E.R. method, providing emotional support, and nurturing
social skills, parents gain strategies and confidence to navigate challenging
conversations effectively.</p>
