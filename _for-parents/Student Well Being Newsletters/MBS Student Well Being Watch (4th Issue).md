<p><strong>Supporting Children Through Bullying: A Parent's Guide</strong>
</p>
<p>Every parent faces that moment when their child comes home upset after
being teased at school. Is this normal childhood conflict, or something
more serious? Building on our previous Bully-Free Week activities that
promoted empathy and inclusion, this edition focuses on the crucial role
parents play in addressing bullying situations. We explore how to distinguish
between hurtful behaviours and actual bullying, and provide practical strategies
for supporting children whether they're experiencing bullying or displaying
bullying behaviour themselves. Using approaches like the C.H.E.E.R. method,
parents can learn to navigate these challenging conversations with confidence.
Discover how to provide emotional support, strengthen children's social
skills, and work collaboratively with schools to create safer environments
for all students.</p>
