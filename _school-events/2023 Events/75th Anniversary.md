On the morning of Friday, 26 May 2023, MBS staff and pupils gathered, bright and early, eager to celebrate an important milestone – Maha Bodhi School’s 75th Anniversary.


Ahead of the 75th Anniversary celebrations, pupils also took part in a 2-week experiential learning programme from 15 to 25 May 2023, where they engaged in collaborative learning activities, exploration of new innovative ideas and learning through hands-on activities. The experiential learning programme culminated with pupils experiencing new and innovative ways in learning as well as enhanced their curiosity in learning.

On the joyous day of the 75 th Anniversary, pupils were treated to an hour-long virtual concert put together by their peers. The performances included items by the School Symphonic Band, Guzheng Ensemble, School Choir, Huang Mei Opera, students’ showcase of “Puti Zhang” and a curation of the alumni’s memorable video montages of their school life in Maha Bodhi School. After the concert, the pupils were immersed in an MBS heritage lesson package that promoted the appreciation of their school history and
finally concluded the celebrations with various activities.

In the afternoon, the second phase of the school celebrations started off with a flurry of
pre-celebration activities, as the guests started streaming in. Guests were involved in
Bathing the Lord Buddha as part of Vesak Day Celebrations as well as a tour of the Art
Exhibition (Spectrum) and hands-on experience at 3D printing with a 3D pen, making
shrinky dinks and button badges.



With the arrival of our Guest-of-honour, Mr Pang Choon How, Principal of Hwa Chong
Institution and an MBS Alumnus, and our distinguished guests, the much-awaited grand
triple launch celebrations, that sought to highlight our commitment to preserving our rich
heritage, fostering sustainability, and giving back to the community, began. 

The celebrations started off with the bathing the Lord Buddha, led by Venerable Kwang
Phing, Venerable Kwang Sheng, Venerable Sumana and Venerable You Guang. This
was followed by the unveiling of the Heritage Corridor, the launch of the Bodhi Garden,
and the launch of our partnership with the Kembangan-Chai Chee Citizen’s Consultative
Committee (CCC).

Our Alumni Association contributed a yummy birthday cake and cupcakes for our guest
to enjoy while our talented pupils wowed the audience with awe-inspiring performances
to showcase their strengths and reflect the rich culture of our school. Guests were taken
down memory lane through the video montages that paid tribute to teachers and
captured the special moments and memories of the days spent in Maha Bodhi School.

Leading up to the 75 th Anniversary Celebrations, in line with our theme of Gratitude &
Giving, we had launched a special fundraising campaign selling notebooks featuring our
school's 75th-anniversary artwork, which was drawn by Mr Tay Thain Lin. We are
thankful to receive generous support for our effort to do our part for the community. All
the proceeds will go towards supporting Metta Home for the Disabled. To round up the
celebrations, harvests from the Bodhi Garden were distributed to the senior citizens
from Kembangan-Chai Chee and the celebrations came to a wrap as all the teachers,
pupils and guests, led by the School Choir, sang the Maha Bodhi School Song with
pride. With the passionate singing, the term-long 75 th Anniversary celebrations officially
come to an end while the pride and nostalgia of being part of the Maha Bodhi family
lived on.
