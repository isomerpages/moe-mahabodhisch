<p>Our pupils illuminated the stage with their captivating Chinese Orchestra
performance at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2024 Arts Presentation.
With the enchanting melodies of Kreta Ayer (饮水思源 牛车水) and the powerful
notes of The General’s Command (将军令), they delivered a stellar performance
that left both the audience and judges in awe. Countless hours of dedicated
training and skill refinement preceded their SYF debut, and their hard
work truly paid off.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, our pupils have forged bonds of friendship and
camaraderie, enriching their experience beyond the stage. Immersed in Chinese
culture and performing arts, they have gained a deeper appreciation for
the traditions and beauty of this art form. These memories will undoubtedly
be cherished as a significant part of their primary school years.</p>
