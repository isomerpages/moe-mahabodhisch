## Outstanding Performance Awards Ceremony (OPAC) 2022

Maha Bodhi School held its 18th Outstanding Performance Award Ceremony, also known as OPAC, on 29 March. It is an annual ceremony which gives recognition to the exceptional performance of our past year pupils in their Primary School Leaving Examinations. It acknowledges the hard work and great effort that the pupils have put in to achieve their goals.

Just like last year, the event is again being live streamed so that the parents of the award recipients can witness this proud occasion while keeping safe. Our Primary 6 pupils were tuned in to watch this ceremony from the classrooms.

Our Guest of Honour, Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, Supervisor of the School Management Committee, Mr Tan Yew Beng and the President of MBS Alumni, Mr Wilfred Seet presented the awards to the prize recipients. We are indeed very grateful for the support of our MBS Alumni.
