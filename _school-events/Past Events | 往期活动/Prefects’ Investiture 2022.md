## Prefects’ Investiture 2022

Every year, Maha Bodhi School holds a Prefects’ Investiture to celebrate the appointment of prefects and to formally induct them into the prefectorial board. This milestone serves as a reminder to all prefects to uphold themselves to the highest standard of excellence as they strive to serve the school. Certificates of appointment were presented to the 113 Prefects by Venerable Seck Kwang Phing and the School Leaders. To close the ceremony, Vice-Principal, Mr Victor Wee, reminded the prefects to always 存好心， 说好话， 行好事 in carrying out their duties.

Maha Bodhi School is proud to present the 2022 Prefectorial Board! Congratulations on your appointment, Prefects!
