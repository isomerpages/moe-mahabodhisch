## 2019 Primary 4 Swimsafer Programme

**<u>2019 Primary 4 Swimsafer Programme</u>**

&nbsp;**Overview**

The SwimSafer Programme aims to equip our pupils with water survival skills and develop his/her self-confidence. The areas covered under the swimming programme are:

1.  <u>Survival Skills.</u> Covers drowning prevention techniques in addition to swimming ability. Pupils are introduced to flotation survival techniques on how to stay alive in water.

1.  <u>Education and Awareness Component.</u> Pupils are taught water safety knowledge, such as rules of behaviour at the pool or near open waters, and water survival knowledge, which include learning how to signal during distress and survive in water long enough before being rescued.

**<u>Primary 4 SwimSafer Programme</u>**

The Swimsafer Programme was open to all Primary 4 pupils.Pupils who signed up for programme attended the lessons on every Monday for 8 weeks at the Geylang Bahru Swimming Complex. The programme which started in Term 1, ended in March.

The pupils were divided into different groups based on their swimming abilities and every group of a maximum of 10 pupils was assigned one instructor. To attain a pass in the programme, pupils not only had to take the practical test at the end of the programme but were also required to take an online quiz.

Over the weeks, it was heartening to see our pupils not only having fun but showing improvements in terms of their ability to swim and in their water-confidence.
