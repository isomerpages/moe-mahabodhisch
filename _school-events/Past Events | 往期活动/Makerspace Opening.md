Makerspace aims to develop pupils to become future ready, creative and resilient makers who care to make a difference. Teachers and pupils showcased and shared the activities and craftwork done in the Makerspace to the guests and did mini craftwork and activities together.

Some activities also allow pupils to show their care for the environment, by using recyclable materials such as old tee shirts, egg trays, toilet paper rolls, etc. and “make” interesting items such as game puzzles and bags. Pupils are also given the opportunity to display their creative talents when they design their very own DIY harmonica, buttons and Shrinky dinks.

The guests were also in awe of our pupils’ creative work with micro:bits and had a hands-on experience with Ozobots and Sphero. They were also showcased to previous projects done by our pupils, which focusses on sustainability, and raising awareness to show care for our environment.
