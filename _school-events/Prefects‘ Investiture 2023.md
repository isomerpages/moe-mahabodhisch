The Prefect Investiture is an annual Student Leadership milestone event to acknowledge and empower the Prefectorial Board in front of the student population. The prefects were reminded of the importance of their service to the school and to consistently uphold the school moto and the school rules. Mr Victor Wee, our Vice-Principal, encouraged the students and prefects to work together harmoniously to make Maha Bodhi School a better learning environment. We would also like to thank Venerable You Guang for gracing the occasion.![](/images/Head%20Prefect%201.jpeg)![](/images/Head%20Prefect%202.jpg)![](/images/Head%20Prefect%203.jpeg)
