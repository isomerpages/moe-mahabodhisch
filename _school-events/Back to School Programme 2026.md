<h4><strong>Back-to-School Programme 2026</strong></h4>
<p>Our Primary 1 students began their educational journey at Maha Bodhi School
with our Back-to-School programme on Friday, 2 January 2026.</p>
<p>This special programme introduced our youngest learners to essential school
routines through engaging classroom activities. Students learnt proper
listening skills, respectful greetings, and canteen procedures. They were
also gifted with the little Maha Bodhi Bear and learnt about the school
crest, motto and values. Our dedicated Peer Support Leaders helped the
new Primary 1 students settle in and feel welcomed into the school community.</p>
<p>Parents attended informative briefing sessions covering curriculum overviews
for English, Mathematics, and Chinese Language. They also had opportunities
to connect with teachers and understand how to support their child's learning
journey.</p>
<p>It was a heartwarming start to the new school year as we welcomed our
Primary 1 families into the Maha Bodhi School community. We look forward
to nurturing these young minds and supporting their growth and development
in the years to come.</p>
