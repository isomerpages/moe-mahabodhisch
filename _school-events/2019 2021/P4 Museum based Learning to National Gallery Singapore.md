## P4 Museum-based Learning to National Gallery Singapore

From 2018, all primary school pupils will get to visit a museum as part of a refreshed art education syllabus aimed at making learning more authentic and for exposure to Singaporean art.  Every child should have at least one authentic experience of looking at a painting in a museum.  National Gallery Singapore is one of the museums nominated by The Ministry of Education for the museum-based learning programme.  Our excited Primary 4 pupils had participated in the school group gallery tours at National Gallery Singapore in Term 1. A recommended list of 32 artworks by local and international artists has also been included in the new art syllabus so that pupils can develop an awareness of Singaporean art.  The gallery has specially curated 12 trails for the pupils, with artworks that depict different themes such as landscapes, portraits and history. There is a greater focus on visual inquiry skills – observation and interpretation – and reflecting on artwork through activities and discussions facilitated by a National Gallery Singapore education facilitator.
