<p>The Maha Bodhi School Choir showcased their talent and dedication at the
Singapore Youth Festival 2024 Arts Presentation on April 18, 2024, where
they proudly received a Certificate of Accomplishment. Comprising pupils
aged 9 to 12, the choir poured months of hard work into perfecting a set
piece and two choice pieces for their performance, which was evaluated
by a panel of five adjudicators.</p>
