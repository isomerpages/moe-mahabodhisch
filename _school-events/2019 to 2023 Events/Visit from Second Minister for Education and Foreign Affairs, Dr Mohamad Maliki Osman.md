## Visit from Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman

Maha Bodhi School is very honoured to host the Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman on 25 August 2022.

During his visit, Dr Maliki interacted with our pupils to find out more about their learning experiences. Our pupils shared their learning from our school-based SAP flagship programme, iPaCC, where they deepened their understanding of the seven cultural modules (琴棋书画茶武艺). They also shared their learning through our Learn for Life Programme, the LEAP, where they learnt more about the major ethnic groups through an appreciation of the various art forms unique to each culture. Our pupils are privileged to learn the Malay language directly from Dr Maliki. He piqued their curiosity to learn more about the language. Pupils also shared their v-logging knowledge learnt from their Applied Learning Programme, the ELECTA, and invited Dr Maliki to record a short clip for the school.

Our pupil leaders shared the importance of supporting their friends in need. They introduced Dr Maliki to the ‘How are you’ jar which pupils can use to elicit their friends’ emotions in a safe setting. Dr Maliki also soaked himself in the makers’ experience when our pupils shared the activities they enjoyed making and experimenting in the school’s Makerspace.

In his dialogue with our teachers, Dr Maliki shared his observation of the pupils’ excitement when they shared their learning experiences. He extended his appreciation to the staff for making it possible for the pupils. He shared the intentions behind some of the national policies and encouraged teachers to continue their good work while harmonizing work-life balance. He stressed on the importance of mental well-being for both pupils and staff.
