<h4><strong>2026 Chinese New Year Celebration</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to nurture an appreciation of Chinese culture
and traditions in our students, Maha Bodhi School will be celebrating Lunar
New Year on Monday, 16 February 2026, as one big school family, from 7:30 am
to 10:30 am.</p>
<p>In celebration of the festival, the school will close immediately after
students’ dismissal to allow our dedicated staff to enjoy quality time
with their families. We kindly request that former students refrain from
visiting teachers on this day.</p>
<p>However, in the spirit of the season and acknowledging our former pupils’
wish to reconnect with their teachers, we have set aside a special period
for such visits. Former pupils who wish to visit are warmly invited to
do so on <strong>23 and 24 February 2026.</strong>
</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth visit, we kindly ask former pupils to inform their
teachers in advance of the intended date and time. This will allow our
security officers to be properly prepared, ensuring the safety and comfort
of everyone involved.</p>
<p>We look forward to celebrating the Lunar New Year together and sharing
the festive spirit with our Maha Bodhi family!</p>
<p>作为特选学校，菩提一直重视弘扬华族传统文化。值此新春佳节来临之际，本校将于 <strong>2026年2月16日（星期一）</strong>举行热闹的新春庆祝会。当天，全校师生将齐聚一堂，共同迎
接充满活力的“马年”，上课时间也将调整为上午7:30至10:30。</p>
<p>庆祝会结束后，学校将在学生离校后关闭，让全体教职员回家与家人一起欢度佳节。校友若希望回校向老师拜年，我们诚挚欢迎大家在<strong>2026年2月23日至24日</strong>期间，提前与老师约定时间，回校送上新年祝福。</p>
<p>我们期待与菩提大家庭一同欢庆农历新年，共享浓浓的新春喜悦！</p>
