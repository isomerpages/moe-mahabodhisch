<p>Every year, Maha Bodhi School holds a Prefectsâ€™ Investiture to celebrate
the appointment of prefects and to formally induct them into the prefectorial
board. This milestone serves as a reminder to all the prefects to uphold
themselves to the highest standard of excellence as they strive to serve
the school. The Prefect badges were presented to the EXCO members of the
prefectorial board by Venerable You Guang and Mrs See. To close the ceremony,
Vice-Principal, Mr Wee, reminded the prefects to always lead themselves
well in upholding the school values as they lead others.</p>
