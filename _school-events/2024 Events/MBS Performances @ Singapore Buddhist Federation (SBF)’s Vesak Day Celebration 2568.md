<h4><strong>MBS Performances @ Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF)’s Vesak Day Celebration 2568</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>SBF’s Vesak Day Celebration 2568 took place on May 12, 2024, at the Singapore
EXPO, honoring the Birth, Enlightenment, and Parinirvana of Lord Buddha.
This year's theme, "Mutual Compassion, Peaceful World," served as a guiding
light for the event. We were honored to have our CCA Indian Dance, Chinese
Dance, and Guzheng Ensemble invited to perform at this auspicious celebration.</p>
