## Singapore Buddhist Federation Vesak Celebration

_**<center>Singapore Buddhist Federation Vesak Celebration</center>**_

_**<center>28 April 2019 @ Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza</center>**_

April 28 was a memorable day for our students and teachers from five performing arts groups as we were invited to partake in the Singapore Buddhist Federation Vesak Celebration at the Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza.

Members from the Guzheng Ensemble, Chinese Dance, Malay Dance, Indian Dance and the school choir put up an array of performances that showcased their talents. From the beautiful sounds of the Guzheng and the melodious voices of the choir, to the brilliantly-choreographed Chinese dance performance, the audience was mesmerized by them all. Adding to the festive atmosphere were awe-inspiring dance performances by the Malay and Indian dance troupes, composed entirely of Chinese girls. They performed the traditional ethnic dances with such lively precision and passion, enthralling the audience.

It was a joyous day with smiles and a sense of accomplishment on our studentsâ€™ faces as they participated in the celebratory event.
