| 2019<br><br> <br>‘Harmony 2019’ – A West Spring Marching Band Production featuring Maha Bodhi Symphonic Band<br> <br> <br>(Saturday, 13th April 2019)<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  | Saturday, 13 Apr 2019, marks an unforgettable day for Maha Bodhi Symphonic Band members. It was a day our school’s band was invited by West Spring Marching Band (WSMB) to perform at the school’s inaugural’s concert, Harmony 2019, which was held at West Spring Secondary School.   Lugging the instruments with them and transferring the bulkier instruments up the delivery truck was nothing new for our band members. What was new was the opportunity for a combined concert and a glimpse of band practice and performance at the secondary school level. Excitement filled the air as our band members boarded the bus and headed for the school in the west, 24 kilometres away.<br><br> <br>With a repertoire of songs that require different skillsets and techniques, our band members were able to enchant the audience while bringing them through music pieces that move their heartbeats along with the rhythm on stage.<br> <br>Star Fantasy is composed by Yo Goto, a Japanese composer. The song’s highlight is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, a song many are familiar.<br> <br>Instant Concert; and A Little Happiness (小幸运) are a rather challenging for primary school students and no other primary school band has played these two songs before.<br> <br>One Direction in Concert is a catchy song that is not too difficult to play and our junior band members were able to take part too.<br> <br>Although it had been a busy morning for our students, giving their all for the performance and receiving numerous applause from the audience certainly made it an enriching and rewarding experience for them. The interaction with senior band members from West Spring Secondary School had definitely made it a meaningful session for our aspiring band members too. | From MBS to WSS:<br>![](/images/loading.jpeg)<br>These ain’t to heavy. We are used to moving them around<br> <br>![](/mages/bus.jpeg)<br>We are ready to set off!<br> <br>![](/images/hall.jpeg)<br>Let’s do our rehearsal first<br> <br>![](/images/qq.jpeg)<br>          Will it be our turn soon? We are so excited!<br> <br>![](/images/band.jpeg)<br>With full concentration, coordination and teamwork, our band members keep the audience in awe of their impressive performance! |
