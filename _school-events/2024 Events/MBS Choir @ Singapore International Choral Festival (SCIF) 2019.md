Maha Bodhi School Choir participated in the 6th SCIF on 3rd&nbsp;August 2019. SICF is a prestigious annual&nbsp; &nbsp;choral competition which sees many choirs from schools in Singapore as well as various Asian countries&nbsp; &nbsp;such as China and Indonesia. The festival is an amalgamation of choristers of different nationalities,&nbsp; &nbsp;cultures and ages who share the same love for music making through singing and sets the bar for the&nbsp; &nbsp;standard of choral singing in Asia.

As part of the choral festival, the choir had an informative and learning session with one of the&nbsp; &nbsp;adjudicators in improving their singing techniques and voice projection.

We thank the school leaders for their support, the parent volunteers who helped with the makeup and&nbsp; &nbsp;accompanied the children throughout, and especially the parents and the students for their time,&nbsp; &nbsp;dedication and hard work. We hope the pupils enjoyed this invaluable experience.
