### 2019 SPSSC Wushu National Competition

**<u>2019 SPSSC Wushu National Competition</u>**

In Term 2, our Wushu team participated in the 2019 National Primary Schools Wushu Competition which was held at Tao Nan Primary School and Pasir Ris Sports Hall.

The standard of the competition was high, but our members persevered and competed fiercely, putting up their very best performance. As a result, we achieved a number of individual awards and our Senior Boys also did us proud by coming in 7th&nbsp;position in the Senior Boys Group Weapon Category.

The individual awards recipients are as follows:

| Name                 | Event                                             |

Our team did very well throughout the competition. The Wushu team will continue to train hard so that they can progress further in next yearâ€™s competition. Well done, boys and girls!
