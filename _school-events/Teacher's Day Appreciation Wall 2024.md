<h3><strong>Teacher's Day Appreciation Wall 2024</strong></h3>

to put on their current school uniform. Students are strongly encouraged
to make prior arrangements with their teachers to inform them of their
visit in view of the crowd expected. All students are reminded to follow
our school rules and adhere to the instructions by our staff members to
facilitate a meaningful visit.</p>
