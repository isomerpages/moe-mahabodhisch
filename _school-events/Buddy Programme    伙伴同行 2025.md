<p>At Maha Bodhi School, we believe that fostering positive relationships
is key to creating a sense of camaraderie and belonging. The Buddy Programme
2025 reflects the school’s dedication to nurturing a culture of care among
its students. By expanding the Buddy Programme across all levels, the school
seeks to instil core values such as respect, care, and kindness, with the
goal of strengthening the sense of community among Maha Bodhians to connect,
interact and develop essential skills.</p>
<p><strong>Back-to-School Programme: </strong>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Primary 5 and 6 students took on the important
role of guiding and mentoring their Primary 2 and 3 buddies as part of
the Back-to-School Programme. This initiative provided an excellent opportunity
for the buddy pairs to engage in a variety of activities that fostered
connection and camaraderie.</p>
<p>The students participated in games together, which not only promoted teamwork
but also brought a fun and lighthearted atmosphere to their interactions.
The buddy pairs went for recess together, strengthening their bond through
shared experiences. In addition, the buddies exchanged handmade cards and
heartfelt words of encouragement, creating a supportive environment where
positive relationships could flourish. This thoughtful combination of play,
communication, and kind gestures laid a strong foundation for lasting connections,
with friendships blossoming naturally as the students engaged with one
another in meaningful ways.</p>
