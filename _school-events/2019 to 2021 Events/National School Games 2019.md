## National School Games 2019

In Term 2, our pupils participated in the National School Games, which is annual event organised by the Singapore Schools Sports Council. In this event, pupils from schools across Singapore come together to compete in various sports.

For our non-CCA based participation, our pupils took part in the 2019 SPSSC National School Games Taekwondo Championships and the 60th National Primary Schools Swimming Championships 2019 this year.

After having to compete against over 30 competitors, 2 of our pupils did us proud in their respective events.

In the Junior Division Boys, Poomsae Green 5 Category, Lee Hong Yi Jordan from   1 Excellence clinched the 4th place.

Chu Hong E, from 2 Faith managed to clinch 2 medals, 2nd and 4th place for the Junior Division Boys Poomsae Yellow 7 and Yellow 8 category respectively.

The standard of the competition was high, and all our pupils competed fiercely, putting into use the skills they had learnt. Even though not everyone managed to win a medal, all of them showed their grit, perseverance and determination. Well done, boys and girls!
