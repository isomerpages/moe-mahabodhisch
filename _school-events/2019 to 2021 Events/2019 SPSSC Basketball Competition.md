## 2019 SPSSC Basketball Competition

In Term 1, our team participated in the Senior Boys Division of the 2019 SPSSC Basketball National & Zonal Competition. There were 13 teams taking part in the Senior Boys Division from different schools participating in the competition. Our school played all the 6 Preliminary Round matches at our Indoor Sports Hall.  We came in second in our group and qualified for the top 4 placing in the East Zone competition.

The semi-finals and finals were played at Tampines Sports Hall. The boys did very well to win the semi-finals match against Telok Kurau Primary School. It was a close match during the finals but we were edged out by Tao Nan School and emerged runners-up in the East Zone competition.

The standard of basketball was high, and our boys competed valiantly, putting their skills to the test and rising up to the challenge. Our team did very well throughout the competition. Well done, boys and girls!! Continue to do well at the National competition.
