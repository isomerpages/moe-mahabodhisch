## 2019 School Visit

**18 February 2019**

Maha Bodhi School hosted a visit to Professor Toshiyuki Kihara, Dean of the United Graduate School of Professional Teacher Education from Osaka Kyoiku University. During his short visit, he participated in a professional conversation with our School Leaders and had the chance to observe our teachers (Mrs Low-Lee Minyu/ SH Mathematics and Miss Por Pei Yi) in action with their pupils. Â He was amazed at the resources available for teaching and learning, the quality of teaching by our teachers and the joyful learning of our pupils.
