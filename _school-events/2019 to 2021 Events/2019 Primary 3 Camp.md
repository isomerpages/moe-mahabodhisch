## 2019 Primary 3 Camp


**Primary 3 Outdoor Adventure Camp**

A collaboration between English, PE and Science departments, the Primary 3 Outdoor Adventure Camp was held at Camp Challenge in Sembawang. Our Primary 3 pupils had their first ever experience of an overnight camp in MBS on 11 and 12 of July 2019.

The pupils took part in a variety of activities that reinforce our school values such as Resilience and Compassion. Pupils were given opportunities to put into practice these values through completing activities such as rock-climbing, blind man’s trail and other team-building activities.

As part of the P3 English curriculum, the pupils were given a chance to scale up a rock wall in one of the activities. This experience gave them an opportunity to relate to and have a better understanding of the emotions of the main character in the story “Cliffhanger” that they have read in their English lessons. It exposed them to the real-life experience of the equipment that they have read about in the story. To many, rock climbing was a first for them and as they encountered challenges, they learnt to be resilient and overcome those challenges with the support of the facilitators, teachers and classmates.

To enrich their learning further in line with the Science curriculum, the Science Department organised a Zoo trail as part of the camp experience. The Zoo trail allowed our pupils to not only navigate and explore the zoo as a team but also learn about the different animal groups, such as mammals and reptiles and their habitats.

The P3 camp was truly an enriching and holistic experience for the pupils as they were able to learn and relate back to their different lessons in school while at the same time, experiencing and learning new skills in the outdoors.
