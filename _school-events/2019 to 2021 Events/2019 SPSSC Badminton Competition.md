## 2019 SPSSC Badminton Competition

### 2019 SPSSC Badminton Competition**

In Term 1, our Badminton teams participated in the 2019 SPSSC Badminton East Zone Competition which were played at Temasek Primary School and Kong Hwa School. Three teams, the Senior Boys, Junior Boys and Junior Girls represented Maha Bodhi School at the competition.

Our Senior Boys did us proud! The tenacity our Senior Boys displayed paid off when the team moved on to the second round of the competition. This was the first time in more than ten years that a team from Maha Bodhi School has made it through to the second round.

The standard of the competition was high, and our players competed fiercely, putting into use the skills they had learnt. Our teams did very well throughout the competition. Our players will continue to train hard so that they can progress further in next year’s competition. Well done, boys and girls!
