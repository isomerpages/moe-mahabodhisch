Maha Bodhi School Choir participated in the 6th SCIF on 3rd August 2019. SICF is a prestigious annual   choral competition which sees many choirs from schools in Singapore as well as various Asian countries   such as China and Indonesia. The festival is an amalgamation of choristers of different nationalities,   cultures and ages who share the same love for music making through singing and sets the bar for the   standard of choral singing in Asia.

This is the third year Maha Bodhi School Choir competed in the category of 12 years and below and we   are honored to attain Silver in the competition.

As part of the choral festival, the choir had an informative and learning session with one of the   adjudicators in improving their singing techniques and voice projection.

We thank the school leaders for their support, the parent volunteers who helped with the makeup and   accompanied the children throughout, and especially the parents and the students for their time,   dedication and hard work. We hope the pupils enjoyed this invaluable experience.
