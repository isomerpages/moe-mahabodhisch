## Outstanding Performance Awards Ceremony 2019

This yearâ€™s OPAC was held on 26 March. There were 43 recipients with aggregates of 250 and above. In addition, 1 pupil taking Foundation Subjects received special awards for commendable results. He qualified for the Normal Academic course.

Parents of the prize recipients were present to witness and celebrate the proud occasion with their children. Each recipient received a certificate and a plaque from the school. Our MBS Alumni had again generously awarded $100 to each recipient. The 3 top pupils, Aurelius Yong Xuan Pichlmaier, Chionh Teng Hui and Lee Yun Ying, Mavis were awarded $200 each by the Alumni.

Our Guest of Honour, Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, Supervisor of the School Management Committee, Mr Tan Yew Beng and the President of MBS Alumni, Mr Wilfred Seet presented the awards to the prize recipients. MBS Alumni had also sponsored the photography for the event. We are indeed very grateful for the support of our MBS Alumni.
