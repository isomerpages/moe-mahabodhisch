Maha Bodhi School Choir performed at Singapore Buddhist Lodge Tri-Celebrations on 2 January 2020 for distinguished guests, including Mr Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Finance.

We thank the school leaders for their support, the parent volunteers who helped with the makeup and accompanied the children throughout, and especially the parents and the students for their time, dedication and hard work. We hope the pupils enjoyed this invaluable experience and brought melodious joy to all present at the celebration.
