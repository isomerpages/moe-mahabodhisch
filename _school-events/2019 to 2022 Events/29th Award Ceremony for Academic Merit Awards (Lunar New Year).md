## 29th Award Ceremony for Academic Merit Awards/Lunar New Year Charitable Donations and Hong Bao Presentation

On 27 January 2019, our concert band was invited to perform at the Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Temple Association. This is an important event for our concert band members as they are privileged to be invited to perform yearly.

It was a busy morning for our students as they prepared to depart for the performance. Their hearts were filled with excitement as they prepared their instruments and boarded the bus.

Our band helped usher in the Chinese New Year by performing a series of New Year favourites such as 贺新年and 大地回春, allowing all guests present to soak in the joyous festive mood.  Although it had been a busy morning for our students, watching the guests wear smiles on their faces while they enjoyed the performance certainly made it an enriching and rewarding experience.
