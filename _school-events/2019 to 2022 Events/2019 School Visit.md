## 2019 School Visit

**18 February 2019**

Maha Bodhi School hosted a visit to Professor Toshiyuki Kihara, Dean of the United Graduate School of Professional Teacher Education from Osaka Kyoiku University. During his short visit, he participated in a professional conversation with our School Leaders and had the chance to observe our teachers (Mrs Low-Lee Minyu/ SH Mathematics and Miss Por Pei Yi) in action with their pupils.  He was amazed at the resources available for teaching and learning, the quality of teaching by our teachers and the joyful learning of our pupils.

School Leaders, Middle Management Team members and teachers spent an engaging afternoon interacting with our partner school, Sekolah Indonesia Singapura. Together with them were 40 visitors consisting of school leaders and administrators from Pakuan University, Jakarta. The guests enjoyed an afternoon of sharing on educational matters and went on a tour of the school’s Heritage Gallery where they learnt more about the school’s humble beginnings. They proceeded to Hua Yi Xuan to gain some insights on programmes we conduct to help our pupils deepen their appreciation of the Chinese Culture. The visitors also had a first-hand experience of three co-curricular activities, Basketball, Wushu and Lion Dance. The visit culminated with a tour of our Art Gallery to view the beautiful artworks done by our pupils and teachers.
