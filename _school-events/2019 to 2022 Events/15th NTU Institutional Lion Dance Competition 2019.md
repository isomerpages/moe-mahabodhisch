## 15th NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition 2019


**<u>15th NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition</u>**

In Term 2, our Lion Dance teams participated in the 15th NTU Institutional Lion Dance Competition 2019 which was held at Our Tampines Hub. This year, we sent in two teams to participate in the Primary School Category.

We faced strong competition from our competitors but our teams persevered and put up a tough fight. As a result, Team A came in as the Overall Champion in the Primary School Category and Team B achieved the Bronze award.

Our boys will continue to do their best as they look forward to the next competition. Keep up the good work, MBS Lion Dance CCA!
