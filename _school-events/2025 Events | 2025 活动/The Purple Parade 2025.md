<h4><strong>The Purple Parade 2025: Celebrating Inclusion and Understanding Hearing Loss</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>On 4 November 2025, Maha Bodhi School proudly joined the nationwide celebration
of The Purple Parade, a movement that promotes inclusion and celebrates
the abilities of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, “Understanding Hearing Loss,” encouraged our students
and staff to build greater awareness, empathy, and appreciation for individuals
with hearing loss. The event was made even more meaningful through our
collaboration with Mayflower Primary School, a Designated Mainstream School
supporting students with hearing loss.</p>
<p>The morning began with a special awareness talk by a children’s book illustrator
with hearing loss, who shared her inspiring journey of creativity and resilience.
Through her story, students learned that communication goes beyond words
— it is also about connection, understanding, and heart.</p>
<p>Participants took part in a series of interactive and creative activities
that incorporated basic sign language and finger spelling, enabling students
to experience firsthand the beauty and expressiveness of non-verbal communication.
The highlight of the celebration was a collaborative art piece created
by students and staff from both schools, symbolizing unity and a shared
commitment to inclusion. The completed artwork was presented to Mayflower
Primary School as a token of appreciation and continued partnership.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a sense of joy, pride, and reflection — reminding
everyone that inclusion is more than an occasion; it is a mindset and a
shared responsibility.</p>
<h4><strong>2025年紫色行动：推广包容文化与认识听力障碍</strong></h4>
<p>2025年11月4日，菩提学校举办了 “紫色行动” 嘉年华活动。旨在推广包容文化，宣扬建设包容社会的意义，并颂扬残障人士的才华与坚毅精神。</p>
<p>今年“紫色行动”的主题是“认识听力障碍”，鼓励学生与教职员提升对听力障碍人士的认知、同理心与尊重。通过与美华小学的合作，本次活动更具意义。美华小学是本地第一所录取失聪学生的主流小学。</p>
<p>活动以一场特别的宣导讲座拉开序幕，主讲人是一位患有听力障碍的儿童绘本插画家。她分享了自己充满创意和坚韧不拔的励志故事，让学生们体会到沟通不仅仅是语言的交流，更是心与心的连结与理解。</p>
<p>随后，参与者参加了一系列互动和创意活动，包括基础手语和指拼法，让学生们亲身体验非语言交流的美感和表现力。活动的亮点之一，是由两校师生共同创作的一幅艺术作品，象征着团结和对包容的共同承诺。这幅作品最终赠予美华小学，作为感谢与持续合作的象征。</p>
<p>活动在欢乐、自豪与深思中圆满结束，提醒着每一位参与者：包容不仅仅是一场活动，它更是一种思维模式和一份共同的责任。</p>
