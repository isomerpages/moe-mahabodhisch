<p>The school will be celebrating Teachers' Day on <strong>4 September</strong>.</p>
<p>We warmly welcome our former pupils to visit their teachers between <strong>11.15 a.m. and 12.30 p.m</strong>.
Pupils who are currently studying in secondary schools or junior colleges
are reminded to wear their current school uniform during their visit.</p>
<p>To help manage the expected crowd, we strongly encourage all former pupils
to inform their teachers in advance if they plan to visit. Visitors are
also reminded to observe school rules and follow the instructions given
by staff members to ensure a safe and meaningful visit for all.</p>
