<h3><strong>Teachers' Day Celebration</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Maha Bodhi School’s Teachers’ Day celebration was marked by a series of
meaningful events that reflected the school community’s spirit of gratitude
and respect for its educators. It began with a Hi-Tea Lunch hosted by the
School Management Committee, expressing appreciation to all staff for their
dedication and care. The celebration continued with a Tea Offering Ceremony,
where students paid tribute to Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, school leaders,
teachers, and non-teaching staff, and culminated in a Teachers’ Day Celebration

its educators.</p>
