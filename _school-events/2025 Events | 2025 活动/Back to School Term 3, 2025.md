<h4><strong>Back-to-School Programme (Semester 2)</strong></h4>
<p>The Back-to-School (BTS) Programme kicked off on the first day of Term
3 Week 1 to mark the start of a refreshed and purposeful school term. The
objective of the BTS Programme was to prioritise student well-being while
creating opportunities for students across different levels to connect
and build stronger relationships. Through a series of thoughtfully designed
activities, the programme aimed to ease students back into the school environment,
foster a sense of belonging and encourage meaningful peer interaction after
the term break.</p>
<p>As part of the BTS Programme, a range of buddy and bonding activities
were carried out to strengthen peer relationships. Primary 2 and Primary
5, as well as Primary 3 and Primary 6 students, enjoyed shared recesses
with their buddies. The older students took the lead by picking up their
younger peers and spending meaningful time together in the canteen, engaging
in conversations and light-hearted bonding over food. It was a good time
filling one another in on things that happened over the holidays and the
past term. These activities helped to foster stronger connections in the
school, beyond the classroom and their levels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Primary 1 and Primary 4 students had Buddy Time in the classrooms,
where they played interactive games and exchanged small gifts as tokens
of friendship. During Experiential Learning Week last semester, the Primary
1 pupil made gratitude messages in recycled plastic bottles for their Primary
4 buddies. Buddy Time allocated on the first day of school gave them an
opportunity to present it to their buddies, and bond with them over games.</p>

<p>Overall, the BTS Programme successfully achieved its goal of promoting
student well-being and fostering a sense of belonging across the school
community. By encouraging interactions that went beyond class and level
boundaries, students formed new friendships, strengthened existing bonds,
and returned to school with a renewed sense of connection. The thoughtful
design of the activities helped create a positive and inclusive atmosphere,
setting the tone for a supportive term ahead.</p>
