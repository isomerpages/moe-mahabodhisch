<p><strong>Experiential Learning Week (ELW) 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Experiential Learning Week (ELW) 2025 at Maha Bodhi School was a joyful
and meaningful week designed to engage students in authentic, hands-on
learning experiences beyond the traditional classroom. Rooted in the school’s
objective of nurturing compassionate and motivated problem solvers, ELW
provided opportunities for students to develop real-world competencies
while deepening their sense of care, creativity, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Each level experienced a specially curated series of activities. Our Primary
1 and 2 students explored themes of empathy, responsibility, and teamwork
through buddy gift-making using upcycled materials, Pu Ti Zhang, and a
problem-solving challenge to solve challanges and design inclusive playgrounds.
They also experienced GEM week dress-up activities and learned basic block-based
programming using Coding Awbie.</p>
<p>At the Primary 3 and 4 levels, students solved subject-integrated puzzles
through a multi-disciplinary Problem Solving Challenge. They explored career
options at ECG booths and talks, took part in VIA activities such as classroom
clean-ups, and expressed their appreciation to the community's unsung heroes.
Highlights included coding sessions with Ozobots in the Makerspace, designing
with 3D pens, and going on learning journeys to the National Gallery and
Ubi Grove.</p>
<p>Primary 5 students developed their communication, creativity, and computational
thinking through music lessons using the ukulele and Code for Fun programming
sessions using Sphero. They also engaged in team-based classroom activities
that strengthened social bonds and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, students also had the opportunity to take part in
Chinese cultural activities and competitions that promoted joyful engagement.</p>
<p>ELW 2025 was not only a celebration of joyful learning but also a purposeful
platform for students to build 21st-century competencies such as collaboration,
adaptability, digital literacy, and empathy. By encouraging students to
explore, reflect, and contribute meaningfully to the world around them,
ELW remains a key initiative in shaping confident,</p>
<p>caring, and future-ready Maha Bodhians.</p>
