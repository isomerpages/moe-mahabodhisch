<h4><strong><u>An Afternoon with Teachers to Start the Year</u></strong></h4>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, we believe that a strong partnership between school
and home sets the foundation for every student's success. To kickstart
the year, our school hosted the annual ‘Afternoon with Teachers’ sessions,
bringing together teachers, parents, and guardians together for a meaningful
afternoon of connection and collaboration.</p>
<p>The sessions opened with a warm address by our School Leaders, who highlighted
the school's goals and aspirations for 2025 followed by sharing sessions
from HOD/Student Management and Year Heads. Parents were introduced to
key initiatives planned for the year, which included academic programmes,
co-curricular activities, and character development frameworks.</p>
<p>Parents had the opportunity to connect with their child’s teachers during
these sessions. The interactions provided valuable insights into their
child’s learning journey and offered practical strategies on supporting
their growth at home. Teachers also shared classroom practices that enhance
learning, helping to build a strong sense of collaboration, trust, and
mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The ‘Afternoon with Teachers’ sessions were a success, with parents expressing
appreciation for the opportunity to connect with teachers and gain a clearer
understanding of their child’s educational journey in Maha Bodhi School.
As we embark on another year of learning, these sessions reaffirmed the
importance of home-school partnership in nurturing each child’s potential.</p>
<p>Let’s continue to strengthen our strong home-school partnership, fostering
a vibrant and supportive community where every student can grow, thrive
and reach their full potential.</p>
