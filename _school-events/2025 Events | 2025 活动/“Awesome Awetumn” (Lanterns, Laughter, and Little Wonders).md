<h4><strong>“Awesome Awetumn” (Lanterns, Laughter, and Little Wonders)</strong></h4>
<p>Our school successfully hosted the "Awesome Awetumn" festival on <strong>Thursday, 2 October 2025</strong>,
combining the celebrations of Mid-Autumn Festival and Children's Day in
a morning filled with cultural activities and joyful learning. The event
was particularly meaningful as Venerable Seck Kwang Phing graced the occasion
with his presence, adding spiritual significance and meaning to the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Heritage Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>The festival featured three activity zones that immersed pupils in traditional
cultural experiences. Pupils rotated through stations offering traditional
children's games such as archery and beanbag toss, cultural heritage activities
including tea appreciation, shadow puppet shows and sugar painting demonstrations.
These hands-on experiences allowed pupils to connect with their cultural
roots whilst enjoying festive celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>Holistic Learning Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the cultural heritage activities, the day’s programme incorporated
"Happy Moments with Form Teachers" sessions that strengthened class bonds
through celebratory activities, alongside Sharity lesson packages that
reinforced important notions of compassion, character development and community
service.</p>
<p><strong>A Celebration Made Possible by the Community Coming Together</strong>
</p>
<p>This festival was made possible through the collaborative efforts of vendors,
parent volunteers, and teachers who staffed the various activity stations.</p>
<p>The presence of Venerable Seck Kwang Phing gracing the ceremony elevated
the entire celebration, transforming it into a meaningful community gathering
that honoured tradition, fostered learning, and brought pupils, teachers
and parents together in the shared spirit of both festivals.</p>
