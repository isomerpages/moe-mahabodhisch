<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness Week 2025: Empowering Students for a Safer Digital World</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Cyber Wellness Week was a vibrant celebration of safe and responsible
digital living, made even more meaningful through the strong support of
our school personnel and Parent Support Group. The week began with an engaging
assembly, “Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Cyber Wolf,” a creative
twist on the classic tale that encouraged reflection on how our online
presence can influence our personal safety and reputation. During recess,
the courtyard came alive with six interactive cyber wellness stations covering
topics such as spotting AI-generated images, practicing netiquette, and
using the S.T.A.R.S. strategy to handle online challenges. Students collected
clues at each station to unlock a special code and redeem a commemorative
sticker. The joint efforts of staff, parents and students created a lively,
supportive environment that inspired all to be mindful, respectful and
responsible digital citizens.</p>

<p>网络安全周在全校师生与家长支援小组的大力支持下精彩登场！本次活动旨在倡导安全、负责任的数码生活。活动周以一场生动有趣的短剧——《小红帽与网络大灰狼》拉开序幕。这个对经典故事的创意改编，引导学生思考线上行为如何影响个人安全与声誉。休息时间，学校庭院化身为热闹的互动空间，设有六个以网络安全为主题的游戏站，内容包括辨识人工智能生成图片、网络礼仪练习，以及运用
S.T.A.R.S. 策略应对线上挑战等，供学生参与。学生在每个游戏站完成任务即可收集线索，破解特别密码并兑换纪念贴纸。师生与家长齐心协力，共同营造活泼有爱的氛围，鼓励大家做自觉、尊重、负责任的网络公民。</p>
