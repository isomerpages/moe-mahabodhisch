<h4><strong>Celebrating the Lunar New Year with Music and Joy @ Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF)</strong></h4>
<p>On 8 February 2025, our school's Guzheng Ensemble and Choir gave a vibrant
and heartfelt performance at the Lunar New Year Blessing event hosted by
the SBF.</p>
<p>The Guzheng Ensemble mesmerized the audience with their stunning renditions
of 喜洋洋 (Happy and Joyous) and 听我说谢谢你 (Thank You for Everything). Their
harmonious melodies filled the air, spreading festive cheer and a sense
of gratitude. The students’ dedication and passion for the Guzheng were
evident, leaving a lasting impression on everyone present.</p>
<p>Adding to the festive spirit, our young choristers charmed the audience
with their delightful performances of 天天好天 (A Beautiful Day) and 大团圆 (Reunion).
Their sweet voices and radiant smiles created an uplifting atmosphere,
touching the hearts of all in attendance.</p>
