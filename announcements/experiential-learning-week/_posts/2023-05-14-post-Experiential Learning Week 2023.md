**Experiential Learning Week is here!**

From 15 May to 25 May 2023, P3 to P5 pupils will be engaged in a variety of learning activities that require them to work collaboratively, explore new ideas and learn through hands-on activities.

The aim of Experiential Learning Week is to provide pupils with hands-on learning experiences that extend beyond the traditional classroom setting. Some of the activities that pupils will be participating in during the Experiential Learning Week include classroom hands-on activities, learning journeys, coding and making activities, project work, etc. These activities have been designed to provide pupils with a more interactive and engaging learning experience. We hope that the new and innovative ways would instill greater joy of learning and pique pupils' curiosity in learning.
