**Maha Bodhi School 75th Anniversary
菩提学校75周年校庆**

**Gratitude & Giving
感恩与回馈**

We are delighted to share that Maha Bodhi School is 75 this year! This milestone is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our many generations of staff, pupils, parents, and the wider community. As we reflect on our past, we are filled with gratitude for the many individuals who have contributed to the success of our school over the years. We are proud of the achievements of our alumni, who have made positive impacts in various fields. We are also thankful for the ongoing support of our Singapore Buddhist Federation, our School Management Committee, parents, staff, and local community, who have been instrumental in shaping our school's culture and values.

The theme of our 75th Anniversary is ‘Gratitude & Giving’. We will officially launch the start of our 75th Anniversary Celebrations in Term 2. We have planned for a series of events and activities. In addition, we are leveraging our 75th anniversary to raise funds for Metta Home for the Disabled. We have launched a special fundraising campaign to sell notebooks featuring our school 75th anniversary emblem. All proceeds from the sales will go towards supporting Metta Home for the Disabled. We invite you to support our fundraising efforts through the purchase of the special edition notebooks. We will provide more information in our April circulars.

We look forward to celebrating this significant milestone with you and your family.

今年是菩提学校成立的75 周年！这个里程碑见证了我们几代教职和非教职员工、学生、家长和社区的奉献和辛勤工作。当我们回顾过去时，我们对多年来为我们学校做出贡献的许多人充满感激之情。我们为校友们所取得的成就感到自豪，他们在各个领域中都有着正面的影响力。我们也要感谢新加坡佛教总会、学校董事会、家长、学校的工作人员和社区的支持，他们在塑造我们学校的文化和价值观方面扮演了重要的角色。

今年75 周年校庆的主题是“感恩与回馈”。75周年校庆的庆祝活动将从第二学段开始。我们正在安排的一系列活动，其中一项便是为慈光乐陶苑及智障日间活动中心筹款。我们会售卖印有我们学校 75 周年标志的笔记本，销售所得将全数捐赠予慈光乐陶苑及智障日间活动中心。我们诚邀您购买这本特别版的笔记本来支持我们的筹款活动。我们将在四月的家长信函中提供更多详情。

我们期待与您和您的家人一起庆祝菩提学校成立75周年！
