## Alumni Visit on Teachers’ Day (1 September)


Maha Bodhi School is celebrating Teachers’ Day on Thursday, 1 September 2022.

We warmly welcome former Maha Bodhians to visit the teachers from 11.45 am to 1 pm. Students currently schooling in secondary schools or junior colleges are to come, clad in your school uniforms. You are strongly encouraged to make prior arrangements with your teachers to inform them of your visits in view of the crowd expected. You are reminded to follow the school rules and adhere to the instructions given by the school staff to facilitate a meaningful visit. Please note that all visits will only commence at 11.45am.

See you then!
