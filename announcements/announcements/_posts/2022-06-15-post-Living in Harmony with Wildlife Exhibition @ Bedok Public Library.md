Dear Parents/Guardian,

The Living in Harmony with Wildlife Exhibition in collaboration with Bedok Public Library is ready for your viewing from today till 15 June 2022. Our P3 pupils are showcasing their art sculptures made using recycled materials to raise awareness of the impact of plastic pollution on animals and to remind us to dispose of plastic waste properly as well as to practice the three Rs â€“ Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. While you are enjoying the exhibit, do check out the recommended reads on Art and Craft as well as Environment specially curated by the librarians from Bedok Public Library. The recommended books will be placed around our exhibit near the entrance of the library and are available for loan from NLB. See you there!
