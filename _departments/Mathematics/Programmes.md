**Programmes**

*   **A Conceptual Approach to Problem Solving**

Equipping pupils with the skills and heuristics for mathematical problem solving is fundamental to the learning of mathematics. The Mathematics Department has designed a series of problem solving activities (P1 to P3) and heuristics worksheets (P3 – P6) that will systematically enable the pupils to be equipped with the different heuristics and model drawing skills for problem solving.

*   **Math and Science Fiesta**

Math and Science Fiesta is carried out in Term 3 every year. It aims to be an engaging platform for pupils to develop the joy of learning mathematics and also, to see the relevance of mathematics in their daily lives. There are many exciting activities and competitions organised for the pupils. Pupils have to apply their problem solving skills while being engaged in fun and meaningful tasks. They can look forward to be awarded attractive prizes and tokens for their participations.

*   **E2K (Mathematics)**

The E2K Math Programme is designed to enrich the learning experiences of selected pupils who have demonstrated aptitude for mathematics. The E2K Math Programme aims to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills and the love for mathematics through activities such as stories, games and puzzles. Various strategies in problem solving will be explored and higher order thinking skills will be applied to formulate solutions and communicate mathematical reasoning.
