**'To Infinity and Beyond'**

Interesting class activities that were based on the topic of outer space had been planned for pupils to practice and showcase their language skills, ranging from speaking to writing.  
As part of the launch, the English Department had also specially arranged for the character dress-up at recess, where several characters, Darth Vader, Sky Walker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jedi made their special appearances, entertaining the pupils while they were eating in the canteen. In addition, many teachers also participated in the TikTok-inspired challenge where they transformed into space characters of their choice. Not only that, the pupils in Drama Club had put on a skit at the launch on the importance of speaking standard English.

In the classrooms, similar to last year, pupils participated in group activities such as Heads-Up Charades, Choral Recitation and Group Spelling challenge. This year, we have introduced new activities ‘Hear Me Out’ and ‘Lost in Space’ to further engage the pupils.

All these activities, from the poll to the launch to the GEM activities, were a result of the teachers’ strong team spirit and camaraderie in instilling joy of learning in pupils. The English department has also garnered the strong support of all the English teachers as well as the School Leaders, without which the GEM Week would not be a success.

**MBS English Reading Day**

For the second year running, the MBS English Reading Day, akin to World Book Day, was conducted on 13 April 2022. This event aims to encourage our pupils to discover the joy of reading. This year, the MBS English Reading Day celebrated award-winning authors as it showcased their lives and their famous works. The specially curated authors by the English department were Dr Seuss, Beverly Cleary and Madeleine L’Engle. Through MBS English Reading Day, the children immersed themselves in the minds of these talented authors as they listened to excerpts of the stories, played Jeopardy games related to the values displayed by the characters in the stories and watched trailers of their movie adaptations. Most importantly, the MBS English Reading Day also set out to promote parent-child bonding as parents and pupils were encouraged to share their favorite storybooks on Padlet. We hope that through the MBS English Reading Day, the joy of reading has been rubbed off on the pupils, thereby spreading the love of reading among them.
