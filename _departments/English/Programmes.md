**'To Infinity and Beyond'**

Interesting class activities that were based on the topic of outer space had been planned for pupils to practice and showcase their language skills, ranging from speaking to writing.  
As part of the launch, the English Department had also specially arranged for the character dress-up at recess, where several characters, Darth Vader, Sky Walker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jedi made their special appearances, entertaining the pupils while they were eating in the canteen. In addition, many teachers also participated in the TikTok-inspired challenge where they transformed into space characters of their choice. Not only that, the pupils in Drama Club had put on a skit at the launch on the importance of speaking standard English.

In the classrooms, similar to last year, pupils participated in group activities such as Heads-Up Charades, Choral Recitation and Group Spelling challenge. This year, we have introduced new activities ‘Hear Me Out’ and ‘Lost in Space’ to further engage the pupils.

All these activities, from the poll to the launch to the GEM activities, were a result of the teachers’ strong team spirit and camaraderie in instilling joy of learning in pupils. The English department has also garnered the strong support of all the English teachers as well as the School Leaders, without which the GEM Week would not be a success.

**MBS English Reading Day**

For the second year running, the MBS English Reading Day, akin to World Book Day, was conducted on 13 April 2022. This event aims to encourage our pupils to discover the joy of reading. This year, the MBS English Reading Day celebrated award-winning authors as it showcased their lives and their famous works. The specially curated authors by the English department were Dr Seuss, Beverly Cleary and Madeleine L’Engle. Through MBS English Reading Day, the children immersed themselves in the minds of these talented authors as they listened to excerpts of the stories, played Jeopardy games related to the values displayed by the characters in the stories and watched trailers of their movie adaptations. Most importantly, the MBS English Reading Day also set out to promote parent-child bonding as parents and pupils were encouraged to share their favorite storybooks on Padlet. We hope that through the MBS English Reading Day, the joy of reading has been rubbed off on the pupils, thereby spreading the love of reading among them.

### 2020 GEM Week


In 2020, GEM (Good English Movement) Week was held in Term 3 Week 4 (13 July – 16 July 2020). Due to the current COVID-19 situation the English department carried out interesting activities to promote the use of Standard English and reading of storybooks while observing the safe distancing measures. 

To bring about greater awareness and deeper appreciation for the frontline workers, pupils were involved in deciding the theme for the GEM Week. Through a poll conducted throughout the school, the majority of them chose _Our Everyday Heroes_ as the name of 2020 MBS GEM Week. To make it more engaging, we created an avatar whom we named Ms Gem, the host who launched GEM week. To pay tribute to the frontline workers, the English department also turned themselves into a mini choir and recorded and sang the Michael Jackson’s ‘Heal the World’.

Throughout the week, similar to last year, pupils participated in activities in class such as Heads-Up Charades, Readers’ Theatre, Choral Recitation, Group Spelling challenge and Debates all in the spirit of teamwork and inculcating the joy of learning in English, revolving around the theme – Our Everyday Heroes. In place of the physical treasure hunt that we used to have, a new online treasure hunt ‘E-treasure Hunt’ was designed – an adaptation of the well-known reality game, Escape Room. Pupils had to work for clues before they could open the next one and solve the Mystery Word. They were allowed to do this via SLS.

The English department garnered the strong support of the English teachers as well as the school leaders, who participated and contributed to the success of GEM Week. The GEM Week, though a scaled-down version, provided an unforgettable and exciting experience, not only for our pupils but our teachers as well.

### 2020 MBS Stay Home and Read Challenge


**#MBSStayHomeAndReadChallenge**

As part of the post-FHBL May holiday activities, the English department implemented our first MBS Stay Home and Read Challenge. In the midst of the COVID-19 situation, the objectives of the challenge were for our pupils to read more storybooks and also to encourage parents to read together with their child, promoting family bonding. Also we would like our pupils and teachers to pass on the love for reading by recommending the books they had enjoyed reading. The SLS package consisted of an array of activities and resources that included MBS Recommended Book Lists with the links of e-books specially curated and videos of MBS teachers recommending the books that they had read. Padlet links were provided for pupils and teachers to upload their videos and photos of their book recommendations. This initiative was met with an overwhelming response as many pupils shared and uploaded their book recommendations.
