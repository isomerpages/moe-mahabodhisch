## Guiding Principles

### Guiding Principles

Maha Bodhi School’s PE curriculum is guided by Ministry of Education’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes.

### 21st Century Competencies

*   Knowledge and skills must be underpinned by values. Values define a person’s character. They shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of a person, and therefore form the core of the framework of 21st century competencies.
*   The middle ring signifies the Social and Emotional Competencies—skills necessary for children to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, as well as to handle challenging situations effectively.
*   The outer ring of the framework represents the 21st century skills necessary for the globalised world we live in. These are:
*   Civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills
*   Critical and inventive thinking
*   Information and communication skills

### Student Outcomes


The desired outcomes for every student are:

*   a confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively,
*   a self-directed learner who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning,
*   an active contributor who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence,
*   &nbsp;a concerned citizen who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives of others around him.
