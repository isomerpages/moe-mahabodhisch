<p>At Maha Bodhi School, student well-being is at the heart of all we do.
We are committed to fostering a caring and enabling environment where every
student feels supported, valued and empowered to reach their full potential.
Our approach is guided by the schoolâ€™s vision of developing inspired learners
of exemplary character, mission of nurturing lifelong learners and compassionate
contributors, as well as core values of respect, resilience, integrity,
compassion and excellence.</p>
<p>The Student Well-Being Department is dedicated to supporting Maha Bodhians
in core areas such as peer support, cyber wellness, and mental well-being.
We believe that a healthy mind and strong social connections are crucial
for students to unlock their full potential. By focusing on these core
areas, we empower Maha Bodhians to grow into well-rounded individuals who
navigate challenges with resilience, contribute meaningfully to their communities,
and lead lives filled with empathy, purpose and compassion.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Support</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Peer Support programme is designed to create a safe and welcoming
space where students can turn to their peers for help and guidance. Peer
Support Leaders are trained to provide emotional support, offer a listening
ear, and guide fellow students through difficult situations. Through peer
support, we create an environment where students feel recognized, connected,
and embraced as part of a compassionate community, allowing them to flourish
both socially and emotionally. In reaching out and supporting school mates
in need, Peer Support Leaders not only contribute to a supportive and inclusive
atmosphere but also demonstrate the leadership qualities of empathy, integrity,
and service.</p>

<p><strong>Buddy Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In Maha Bodhi School, we believe that building positive relationships
fosters a sense of camaraderie and belonging. The Buddy Programme stands
as a testament to the school's commitment to cultivating a positive culture
of care among its pupils. We recognise the crucial need for pupils to connect,
interact, and develop essential social skills. By extending the Buddy Programme
across all levels, the school aimed to instill values of respect, care,
and kindness, ultimately creating a stronger sense of community among Maha
Bodhians.</p>
