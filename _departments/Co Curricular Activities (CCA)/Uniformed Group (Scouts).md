<h3>Let's learn more about our Scouts CCA in MBS</h3>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Scouts</strong></h4>
<p>As a uniformed group, our Cub Scouts are expected to uphold a strong sense
of discipline, which serves as the cornerstone for learning and mastering
scouting skills. Cubs develop practical skills like first aid, outdoor
survival knowledge and participate in team-building exercises.</p>
<p>Joining Cub Scouts is not just about learning skillsâ€”it's about embarking
on a journey of personal growth and discovery, where each session brings
new opportunities to learn, lead, and make lifelong friendships. Activities
such as camping, knot tying, and community service projects teaches Cubs
the importance of teamwork, responsibility, and respect for others.</p>
<p>These experiences not only prepare them for future adventures in scouting
but also instill values that shape them into conscientious and capable
individuals.</p>
<p>After all, our motto reminds us to always "Be Prepared"</p>
