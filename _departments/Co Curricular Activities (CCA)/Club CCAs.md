<p><strong>Chinese Calligraphy</strong>
</p>
<p>Students can learn the traditional Chinese arts of calligraphy and ink
painting. Through calligraphy, they practice writing Chinese characters
with brush and ink, improving their handwriting and learning about the
beauty of Chinese script. This activity helps develop patience and focus.
In ink painting, students use brushes to create expressive paintings, often
inspired by nature and Chinese culture. They learn to balance ink tones,
brush strokes, and composition. These activities not only teach artistic
skills but also deepen students’ understanding of Chinese culture and foster
creativity and self-expression</p>
<h4><strong>Art Club</strong></h4>
<p>The Art Club is a vibrant space for creativity and collaboration, encouraging
members to express themselves and connect through different forms. Different
art forms could be in the form of painting, craftwork, clay-work or digit
