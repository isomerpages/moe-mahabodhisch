<h4>Environment and Science Club</h4>
<p>Our Environmental and Science Club focuses on engaging students with hands-on
activities that promote environmental awareness and scientific exploration.
We participate in recycling projects, simple experiments, and various initiatives
that help us understand how to protect the Earth. Through these activities,
the club encourages teamwork, creativity, and a passion for making a positive
impact on our environment.</p>

<h4>HOMEC</h4>
<p>Be Empowered! Home Economics students acquire homemaking information and
skills that are helpful in daily life. Homec is also a platform for pupils
to embark on simple yet authentic and purposeful projects. Pupils show
gratitude towards the teachers and showed appreciation to nature as we
collaborated with Herbs Garden CCA. Homec aims to further spread our love
and care towards the community and through such acts, we hope to empower
and be empowered.</p>
