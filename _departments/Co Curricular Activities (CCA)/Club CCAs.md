and journalism skills. Students learn responsible media use and digital

communication, with students writing scripts, narrating, or hosting videos.
These skills are applied in projects like school event coverage and competitions.

<h4>Chinese Calligraphy</h4>
<p>Students can learn the traditional Chinese arts of calligraphy and ink
painting. Through calligraphy, they practice writing Chinese characters
with brush and ink, improving their handwriting and learning about the
beauty of Chinese script. This activity helps develop patience and focus.
In ink painting, students use brushes to create expressive paintings, often
inspired by nature and Chinese culture. They learn to balance ink tones,
brush strokes, and composition. These activities not only teach artistic
skills but also deepen students’ understanding of Chinese culture and foster
creativity and self-expression</p>
