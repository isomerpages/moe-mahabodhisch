<p><strong>Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, our Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies
(NML) framework guide the development of essential ICT and literacy skills
that our students will acquire throughout their six years. These foundational
skills equip them to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world.</p>
<p>The Baseline ICT Standards establish the essential knowledge, skills,
and values our students need to engage with a curriculum enriched by technology.
They ensure that students are prepared to leverage digital tools effectively
and responsibly as they progress through their education.</p>
<p>New Media Literacies (NML), in the context of Singapore schools, emphasize
the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values (SKAV) students must apply
when utilizing technology for learning. These literacies encourage students
to not only use digital tools but to do so critically, creatively, and
ethically.</p>
<p>For Lower Primary students, ICT lessons are conducted by teachers in computer
labs and classrooms, and students also engage in self-directed learning
through curated course packages on the Singapore Student Learning Space
(SLS) platform. Middle Primary students continue with these packages to
reinforce their ICT skills independently.</p>
<p>As they progress, Middle and Upper Primary students will have opportunities
to apply their learning through project work and school assignments, allowing
them to use ICT tools in more practical, real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Through these structured programs, our students progressively build confidence
and competence in ICT, enabling them to become empowered learners in the
digital age.</p>
