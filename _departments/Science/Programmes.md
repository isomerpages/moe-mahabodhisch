## Programmes 

### Save the Earth Programme 

Students participate in activities and competitions, which are organised to promote awareness on environmental issues.

### Learning Journeys

Learning journeys provide opportunities for students to learn science beyond the confines of the classroom in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are also planned to stimulate students’ interest and curiosity in the environment and to instil in them a sense of personal responsibility and concern for the environment, and caring for living things.
