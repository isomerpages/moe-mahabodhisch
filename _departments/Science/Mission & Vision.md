## Mission & Vision 

### Vision


Have a self-inquiring mind and love for the environment.

### Mission


To nurture students to care for the environment, and develop them to be creative, resourceful and independent thinkers with scientific skills for life-long learning.

### Implementation of the Science Syllabus


The approach towards the learning of Science is based on themes that students can relate to in their everyday experiences, and to the commonly observed phenomena in nature.  The five themes are Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions.

The topics that are covered under these themes from P3 to P6 are as shown below.
