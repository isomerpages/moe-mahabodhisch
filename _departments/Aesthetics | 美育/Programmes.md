### Learn for Life Programme 

**L**earning through an&nbsp;**E**thnic&nbsp;**A**rts&nbsp;**P**rogramme (LEAP)

LEAP has been developed by the school with PSE funding since 2006. It is a key distinctive programme of Maha Bodhi School and we pride ourselves to be able to deliver quality learning experiences in visual and performing arts,&nbsp; develop in our pupils an appreciation for the aesthetics, nurture their capabilities and potential as well as discover talents and providing them the opportunities to pursue their passion through enrichment lessons and CCAs. In the process, we seek to inspire, grow, and nurture confident, creative, and innovative individuals who can perceive and understand the world through different lenses.&nbsp; They would also be aware and take pride of their own culture and embrace differences in others.

As a SAP school, the inculcation of inter-racial understanding, appreciation of different ethnic cultures and living in harmony in multi-racial Singapore is especially pertinent.&nbsp; In LEAP, pupils are exposed to the five aspects of art forms, namely: music, dance, drama, 2-D art and 3-D craft, associated with the major ethnic groups in Singapore through a modular approach. Over 6 years, the pupils experience Chinese, Malay and Indian cultural components. For example, in Primary 4, the ethnic theme is Malay culture so pupils learn Batik painting, Malay Music Instruments, Malay dance and Silat. LEAP is used as a platform to promote CCE and SAP ethos so that our predominantly Chinese student body, through the arts, have a heightened awareness of their own culture as well as those of the other races.

LEAP exposes our pupils from P1 to P6 to an enriched aesthetics experience and cultural appreciation while allowing those who exhibit talent and great interest to deepen their learning in the arts. Budding artists and talented pupils in the performing arts participate in interest groups, enrichment lessons or CCAs to sharpen their skills. They are also given opportunities through involvement in public performances, exhibitions and competitions.&nbsp; The Spectrum, a bi-annual visual art exhibition celebrates pupils’ artworks which fosters their self-confidence and sense of achievement.&nbsp; It generates arts discussion and pupils learn from one other. The numerous accolades that our pupils have attained in performances, exhibitions and competitions are testament of LEAP’s excellence.

LEAP supports children in arts development, allows them to be inquisitive, to discover and pursue their interests and strengths in the visual arts, music and dance. It also develops their creativity and hones their values through the development of cultural and aesthetics sensitivity as it provides opportunities for children to appreciate the cultural diverstiy of the different ethnic groups and participates in the beauty around them.

        

**终身学习课程：民族艺术学习** **(LEAP)**

自2006年以来，在教育部补助金的支持下，我校持续发展民族艺术学习 (LEAP) 。LEAP是菩提学校引以为傲的一项重要特色课程，为学生提供优质的视觉和表演艺术学习体验，培养学生对美学的欣赏，激发学生的潜力和才华。LEAP也通过课外活动和兴趣小组为学生提供机会追求他们的热忱。在过程中，我们旨在启发学生、栽培学生、培育学生。培养出自信且富有创意与创新的个体，让他们能够通过多元角度观察且理解世界。不仅如此，他们会意识到自己的文化并为此自豪，也懂得尊重其他种族的文化。

作为一所特选学校，培养种族间的理解、欣赏不同种族的文化和在多元种族的新加坡和谐共处尤其重要。在 LEAP 中，学生通过模块化的课程接触到新加坡主要族群的五种艺术形式：音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、二维艺术和三维工艺。六年来，学生体验了华族、马来族和印度族的文化元素。例如，小学四年级的种族主题是马来文化，因此学生学习蜡染画、马来乐器、马来舞蹈和马来武术。LEAP 成为了促进跨文化教育和特殊辅助学校精神的平台，使我们以华人为主的学生群体通过艺术，对自己的文化以及其他种族的文化有更深入的了解。

LEAP让一年到六年级的小学生，得以欣赏文化以及接触丰富的艺术体验。LEAP同时给予了那些表现出艺术天赋和浓厚兴趣的学生一个能够在艺术领域深造的机会。拥有表演天赋的学生，可以通过参加兴趣小组、课外活动或课程辅助活动，以精进自己的能力。他们也将有机会通过参与公共表演、展览和比赛来展示自己的才能。两年一度的视觉艺术展览《The Spectrum》是展示学生们的作品，也是培养他们的自信心及成就感。《The Spectrum》的视觉艺术展览激发艺术讨论，引导学生相互学习。我们的学生在表演、展览和比赛中获得的诸多荣誉，足以证明 LEAP这个项目非常卓越。

LEAP 支持学生在艺术上的发展，让他们持有好奇心，发现并追求他们在视觉艺术、音乐和舞蹈方面的兴趣和优势。LEAP通过培养文化和审美敏感性来发展学生的创造力，并培养他们的价值观。LEAP让学生得以欣赏不同种族文化的多样性，也让他们有机会体验文化之美。
