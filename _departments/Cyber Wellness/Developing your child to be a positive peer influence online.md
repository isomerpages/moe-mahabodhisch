## Developing your child to be a positive peer influence online

Positive peer influence is a key principle in MOEâ€™s Cyber Wellness Framework which encourages our students to:

*   Be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness technology to do good); and
*   Advocate positive online behaviours (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media).

Please refer to this tip sheet on how to develop your child to be a positive influence online.
