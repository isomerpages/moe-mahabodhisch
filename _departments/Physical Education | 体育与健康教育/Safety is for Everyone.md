<h3>Safety is for Everyone</h3>
<h2>Parents Corner</h2>
<p>While we educate our students on Sports Safety during Physical Education
lessons and during the CCAs, your active involvement to reinforce the safety
points with your children will go a long way to ensure that our children
are mindful of their own safety.</p>
<h3><strong>4 Simple Rules for Sports Safety</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Screening</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Is your child feeling well?</u>
</p>
<p>Children have a tendency to ignore the warning signs that their bodies
tell them.&nbsp; They normally do not want to feel left out. So, reinforcing
the point that they are to refrain from any form of exercise if they are
unwell, will ensure that they do not put unnecessary strain on their bodies
and will be able to recover faster to join their friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All individuals, including children need to do separate warm up
and stretching exercise so the body is adequately tuned up for the demands
of exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Adequate Hydration</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<u>Is your child adequately hydrated?</u>
</p>
<p>Children need to be reminded that if they participate in physical activities,
they must drink up before, during and after the activity to prevent their
bodies from overheating. Ensure your child has a bottle of water during
any activity, especially during physically education. Passing clear or
light-coloured urine is a sign that they are adequately hydrated. Inadequate
hydration can result in fainting spells and even heat stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Play &amp; Injury Prevention</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Does your child understand why Fair Play is important?</u>
</p>
<p>Fair Play is a key part of an injury-free sports environment. By abiding
by the rules of the games and adhering to the principles of fair play –respect,
integrity and fairness, they can reduce the risk of injuries that can occur
from unsporting behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Is your child aware of the safety precautions playing in different environment?</u>
</p>
<p>Understanding the environment is an integral part of sports safety. Playing
in the open space when there is lightning or when there is lightning alert
exposes them to unnecessary danger. Similarly, children need to be aware
that if the weather is hot and/or sunny and they are participating in physical
activities, they need to be adequately hydrated.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Is your child properly attired?</u>
</p>
<p>Children should be reminded that wearing protective sports gear and using
the correct sports equipment reduce the risk of injury and harm. They should
be alert enough to look out for any equipment which is damaged and alert
the teachers or instructors immediately.</p>
