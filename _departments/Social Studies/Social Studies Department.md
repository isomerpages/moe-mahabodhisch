**<u>P1 FBL to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden</u>**

The P1s visited the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden this year. They were taught to identify different family of plants and learned about the usefulness of plants in our daily lives. They were given the opportunity to observe the birds and insects in the Gardens. Finally, we hope they have picked up tips on respecting the flora and fauna in nature and our environment.

**<u>P2 FBL to Philatelic Museum**</u>

The P2 pupils went to the Philatelic Museum. During the one and a half hour that pupils spent at the museum, they gained an understanding of the world of stamps. They learnt about how stamps first came about and its evolution, from black and white to colour and from non-perforated to perforated. They learnt about how national symbols are depicted in stamps as well as the countries that are around Singapore. As stamps are often used to commemorate important events in a nation, pupils worked on a stamp design to depict an important event in their life as a post event activity.
