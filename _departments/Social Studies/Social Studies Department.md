The P2 pupils went to the Philatelic Museum. During the one and a half hour that pupils spent at the museum, they gained an understanding of the world of stamps. They learnt about how stamps first came about and its evolution, from black and white to colour and from non-perforated to perforated. They learnt about how national symbols are depicted in stamps as well as the countries that are around Singapore. As stamps are often used to commemorate important events in a nation, pupils worked on a stamp design to depict an important event in their life as a post event activity.

The P3 pupils had a chance to put the skills they have learnt into use during the P3 Station Learning i.e. map reading and locating places of interests in Singapore, identifying the common trees found in Singapore and planning the MRT route to take from one location to another. The theme for the P3 revolves within Singapore so this activity allows them to learn more about the landscape and infrastructure of Singapore.

**<u>P4 Social Studies Station Learning</u>**

The Primary 4 pupils had their Station Learning, which allowed them to have hands-on experience on some of the topics which were covered in the classroom. Since the Primary 4 syllabus is about the development of Singapore from a fishing village to an independant nation, they were exposed to various key moments during this period, in particular, the contributions of our founding fathers and our multiculturalism. Furthermore, the pupils were engaged in map reading, enabling them to locate where our early settlers came from. This has given them a clearer indication about the origins of the early settlers, and also the struggles they went through to come and start a new life here in Singapore.

**<u>Encouragement Letters to our Soldiers</u>**

Our P5 and P6 pupils wrote a letter of encouragement to motivate our young soldiers to do their best for an evaluation test. The military unit prepared some slides for our pupils to view to find out more about what the unit does for the defence of our country. The pupils subsequently pen down their thoughts and well-wishes to the soldiers. The letters were then received by the military unit and handed to the soldiers who were taking the test. The soldiers were touched and found the letters inspiring. The pupils had an opportunity to learn about the background information about our SAF and also to connect to our young men in a meaningful way.
