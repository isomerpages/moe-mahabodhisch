The P2 pupils went to the Philatelic Museum. During the one and a half hour that pupils spent at the museum, they gained an understanding of the world of stamps. They learnt about how stamps first came about and its evolution, from black and white to colour and from non-perforated to perforated. They learnt about how national symbols are depicted in stamps as well as the countries that are around Singapore. As stamps are often used to commemorate important events in a nation, pupils worked on a stamp design to depict an important event in their life as a post event activity.

**<u>P4 Social Studies Station Learning</u>**

The Primary 4 pupils had their Station Learning, which allowed them to have hands-on experience on some of the topics which were covered in the classroom. Since the Primary 4 syllabus is about the development of Singapore from a fishing village to an independant nation, they were exposed to various key moments during this period, in particular, the contributions of our founding fathers and our multiculturalism. Furthermore, the pupils were engaged in map reading, enabling them to locate where our early settlers came from. This has given them a clearer indication about the origins of the early settlers, and also the struggles they went through to come and start a new life here in Singapore.

**<u>P5 Social Studies Station Learning</u>**

The Primary 5 pupils had their Station Learning, which allowed them to have hands-on experience on some of the topics which were covered in the classroom. Since majority of the Primary 5 syllabus is about ancient civilisations, the pupils were exposed to the traditions of these civilisations, in particular, India and Greece. Furthermore, the pupils were also engaged in map reading, enabling them to locate where these civilisations were on the world map.

**<u>Encouragement Letters to our Soldiers</u>**

Our P5 and P6 pupils wrote a letter of encouragement to motivate our young soldiers to do their best for an evaluation test. The military unit prepared some slides for our pupils to view to find out more about what the unit does for the defence of our country. The pupils subsequently pen down their thoughts and well-wishes to the soldiers. The letters were then received by the military unit and handed to the soldiers who were taking the test. The soldiers were touched and found the letters inspiring. The pupils had an opportunity to learn about the background information about our SAF and also to connect to our young men in a meaningful way.

**<u>Insight – A 3D Monumental Journey Exhibition</u>**

The exhibition invited pupils to take a closer look at some National Monuments and admire their features to find out what makes each one unique. Each building has its own story and these combine to tell the grand narrative of Singapore’s development, both as a city and a multicultural society. As pupils examined the images and read the interesting facts, we hope they had gained insights into our history and inheritance. The pupils made use of 3D glasses to admire the 3D stereograms and were delighted to see the buildings come to life.

**<u>Current Affairs Programme</u>**

The Current Affairs Programme was launched to stir curiosity and create interest in the happenings locally and around the world. The NE Ambassador of each class is in charge of posting up a newspaper article fortnightly. They would then encourage their classmates to read the article and pen down their reflections and comments for the class to read. This is done in their free time and hence meaningful self-directed learning takes place. A platform has been created for pupils to think about and engage in common discussion about the events that impact our society. The department has also collaborated with old girls from MBS who were doing a project on media literacy. They came to school to conduct activities to raise awareness of the importance of media literacy. The department also printed a publication that the girls had crafted on current affairs for the P5s and P6s. The P5s also subscribe to a children’s newspaper called What’s up.
