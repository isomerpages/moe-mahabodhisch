National Education / Social Studies
===================================

National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our pupils, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasizes on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore through the commemoration of NE core events and other NE activities and programmes.

National Education is taught through the infusion and integration of NE messages in the core curriculum subjects, non-core subjects, co-curriculum programmes, community involvement programmes and learning journeys.

An integral part of the formal Social Studies curriculum, Field-based Learning in Maha Bodhi School serves to enhance and provide valuable outdoor learning experience in an authentic real-world setting for our pupils. It is meaningful and relevant as we take on a multi-disciplinary approach with a strong emphasis on Social Studies and National Education. Field-based Learning to different venues will give pupils the opportunity to understand Singapore better and instil pride in our achievements. Field Based Learning would also motivate and sustain pupils’ interest in the subject matter as they will learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topics being studied.

### NE Core Events


**<u>Total Defence Day</u>**

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore. For information, check [https://www.totaldefence.sg/](https://www.totaldefence.sg/)

**<u>International Friendship Day</u>**

IFD is commemorated in schools on the 2nd Friday of Term 2 that is a working day. International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to sensitise our children towards the geo-political realities inherent in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

**<u>Racial Harmony Day</u>**

Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21st July. On this day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.

**<u>National Day</u>**

National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day. Schools conduct a **15-minute National Day Ceremony** which is more formal than the festivities that schools usually organise.
