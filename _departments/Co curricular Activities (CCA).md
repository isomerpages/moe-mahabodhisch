## Co-curricular Activities

Participation in Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) in our school is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education experience. We offer our pupils a range of CCAs to develop them in the moral, academic, physical, social, aesthetic and leadership domains, as well as inculcate values and life skills.

If you need more information about the various CCAs, you may email the teachers-in-charge. For administrative matters related to CCAs, you may email our Subject Head for CCA, Mr Muhammad Zulfadly at muhammad\_zulfadly\_zaiman@moe.edu.sg.

**Introduction of two new Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in 2020**

To further support our pupils’ development, the school will be introducing two new CCAs for the year 2020. These two new CCAs are **Tchoukball** and **English Speech and Drama Club.**

**1) Tchoukball**

 Tchoukball is a unique team sport which incorporates teamwork as points are scored when the ball is passed around most effectively. Physical size and fitness not a barrier to joining the CCA. The technical skill and strategy which the coach will focus on during training will determine how well the team does. Good observation, constant attention by all participants, anticipation and intelligence of all facets of the game are required, as is good athletic ability.

**Students will focus on:**

*   Basic ball handling skills
*   Shooting drills
*   Exposure to different game situations
*   Values of team, communication and resilience

Tchoukball **does not involve any contact or tackling** which makes the sport **safe and less intimidating for pupils regardless of their size**.

Many schools are already offering Tchoukball as a CCA. Therefore our pupils have ample opportunities to represent the school in zonal and national competitions. By giving the pupils the opportunity to be exposed and providing them with the fundamentals needed to hone their skill for the sport, we hope that they would be able to continue their passion and eventually move up to play beyond primary level.

**2) English Speech and Drama Club**

English Speech and Drama Club is an exciting new CCA club starting in 2020 for pupils who have the **desire to perform on stage** and **unleash their innate creative flair** and expression.

Drama is an effective way of building a variety of communication skills in an empowering and engaging way. It provides opportunities to develop a range of life skills which will give them an edge in the future.

**Students will focus on:**

*   Stage performance
*   Emceeing skills
*   Thinking on their feet though impromptu action
*   Improving articulation
*   Gain confidence in performing in front of an audience.

**Students may also get the opportunity to:**

*   Experience the process of collaborating in ensemble productions
*   Perform during school events
*   Utilise their emceeing skills for school events.
