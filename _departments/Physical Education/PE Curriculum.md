## PE Curriculum

#### <u>Social and Emotional Competencies</u>


Social-Emotional (SE) competencies anchor the learning in the PE Curriculum. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is an umbrella term that refers to students’ “acquisition of skills to recognise and manage emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, and handle challenging situations effectively” (CASEL).The five SE competencies are; Self Awareness, Social Awareness, Self-Management, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision Making. (Ministry of Education \[MOE, 2010\]

#### <u>Athletics</u>

Athletics in Maha Bodhi School involves primarily running, jumping and throwing activities that promote both personal striving and comparison. Through Athletics, students challenge themselves to run faster and over longer distance, jump for height and distance, and throw objects of different shapes and weight for distance and accuracy.

#### <u> Dance </u>


 **Physical Education**

Dance develops in students an understanding of rhythmic movement. It also enables students to express and communicate feelings and ideas through exploration, creation and performance. Through a variety of learning experiences ranging from creative to other dance forms, the enjoyment and appreciation of the quality of movement can be achieved. As part of the school curriculum, students are given opportunities for involvement in and enjoyment of different dances which can promote harmony and respect for cultural differences.

**Programme for Active Learning** 

The Dance module engages our students through a variety of dance activities, for example, movement exploration, creative movement and dance performance.  PAL allows our students to explore and experience different dance forms and dance genres and provide opportunities for students to express their thoughts and feelings through various types of dance activities as they explore, create and improvise through dance making. Students are also able to share their ideas with others as these interactions enable them to develop their interpersonal and social skills, attitudes and values.

### <u> Games and Sports</u>


#### Physical Education

Games and Sports in Maha Bodhi School seeks to expose students to various sports and provide the opportunities for students to participate in sporting activities through 3 main components:

**Skills Development** – Focuses on basic fundamentals of manipulative skills and are mainly taught in Primary 1 to 3. Combination skills like catching and throwing an object to a teammate are taught from Primary 4.
