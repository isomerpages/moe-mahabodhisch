<p><strong>Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Maha Bodhi School, our <strong>Baseline ICT Standards</strong> and <strong>New Media Literacies (NML)</strong> framework
guide the development of essential ICT and literacy skills that our students
will acquire throughout their six years. These foundational skills equip
them to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseline ICT Standards</strong> establish the essential knowledge,
skills, and values our students need to engage with a curriculum enriched
by technology. They ensure that students are prepared to leverage digital
tools effectively and responsibly as they progress through their education.</p>
<p><strong>New Media Literacies (NML)</strong>, in the context of Singapore
schools, emphasize the <strong>skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values (SKAV)</strong> students
must apply when utilizing technology for learning. These literacies encourage
students to not only use digital tools but to do so critically, creatively,
and ethically.</p>
<p>For <strong>Lower Primary students</strong>, ICT lessons are conducted
by teachers in computer labs and classrooms, and students also engage in <strong>self-directed learning</strong> through
curated course packages on the <strong>Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong> platform. <strong>Middle Primary</strong> students
continue with these packages to reinforce their ICT skills independently.</p>
<p>As they progress, <strong>Middle and Upper Primary students</strong> will
have opportunities to apply their learning through <strong>project work and school assignments</strong>,
allowing them to use ICT tools in more practical, real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Through these structured programs, our students progressively build confidence
and competence in ICT, enabling them to become empowered learners in the
digital age.</p>

<p><strong>Computational Thinking</strong> is a structured problem-solving
process that allows students to break down complex issues and communicate
precise instructions to a computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming</strong> focuses on giving clear, specific instructions
to a computer or robot. Using <strong>block-based programming</strong>,
students will learn to program the <strong>Sphero robot</strong> to light
up in different colors, move, draw shapes, use loops to repeat instructions,
and react to events through sensor data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> introduces students to how
machines and computers can be programmed to learn from data and experiences,
mimicking human behavior. Students will explore how AI improves over time
without explicit programming, giving them insight into modern technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coding Curriculum: P4 Code Monkey</strong>
